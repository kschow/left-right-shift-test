BALLANTYNE.\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE.\n\nHOW THE FIGHT BEGAN.\n\nOne's own fireside is, to all well-regulated minds, a pleasant subject\nof contemplation when one is absent, and a source of deep gratification\nwhen present.\n\nEspecially may this be said to be the case in a cold, raw night in\nNovember, when mankind has a tendency to become chronically cross out of\ndoors, and nature, generally, looks lugubrious; for, just in proportion\nas the exterior world grows miserably chill, the world \"at home,\" with\nits blazing gas, its drawn curtains, its crackling fires, and its\nbeaming smiles, becomes doubly comfortable and cosy.\n\nEven James Auberly, pompous, stern, and ungenial though he was, appeared\nto entertain some such thoughts, as he sat by his own fireside, one such\nnight, in his elegant mansion in Beverly Square, Euston Road, London;\nand smiled grimly over the top of the _Times_ newspaper at the fire.\n\nMr Auberly always smiled--when he condescended to smile--grimly.  He\nseldom laughed; when he did so he did it grimly too.  In fact, he was a\ngrim man altogether; a gaunt, cadaverous, tall, careworn, middle-aged\nman--also a great one.  There could be no question as to that; for,\nbesides being possessed of wealth, which, in the opinion of some minds,\nconstitutes greatness, he was chairman of a railway company, and might\nhave changed situations with the charwoman who attended the head office\nof the same without much difference being felt.  He was also a director\nof several other companies, which, fortunately for them, did not appear\nto require much direction in the conduct of their affairs.\n\nMr Auberly was also leader of the fashion, in his own circle, and an\noracle among his own parasites; but, strange to say, he was nobody\nwhatever in any other sphere.  Cabmen, it is true, appeared to have an\nimmense respect for him on first acquaintance, for his gold rings and\nchains bespoke wealth, and he was a man of commanding presence, but\ntheir respect never outlived a first engagement.  Cabmen seldom touched\ntheir hats to Mr Auberly on receiving their fare; they often parted\nfrom him with a smile as grim as his own, and once a peculiarly daring\nmember of the fraternity was heard blandly to request him to step again\ninto the cab, and he would drive him the \"nine hundred and ninety-ninth\npart of an inch that was still doo on the odd sixpence.\"  That generous\nman even went further, and, when his fare walked away without making a\nreply, he shouted after him that \"if he'd only do 'im the honour to come\nback, he'd throw in a inch an' a half extra for nothink.\"  But Mr\nAuberly was inexorable.\n\n\"Louisa, dear,\" said Mr Auberly, recovering from the grim smile which\nhad indicated his appreciation of his own fireside, \"pour me out another\ncup of coffee, and then you had better run away to bed.  It is getting\nlate.\"\n\n\"Yes, papa,\" replied a little dark-eyed, dark-haired girl, laying down\nher book and jumping up to obey the command.\n\nIt may be added that she was also dark-dressed, for Mr Auberly had\nbecome a widower and his child motherless only six months before.\n\nWhile Louisa was pouring out the coffee, her father rose and turned his\nback to the fire.\n\nIt was really interesting, almost awe-inspiring, to behold Mr Auberly\nrise; he was so very tall, and so exceedingly straight.  So remarkably\nperpendicular was he, so rigidly upright, that a hearty but somewhat\nrude sea-captain, with whom he once had business transactions, said to\nhis mate on one occasion that he believed Mr Auberly must have been\nborn with a handspike lashed to his backbone.  Yes, he was wonderfully\nupright, and it would have been downright madness to have doubted the\nuprightness of the spirit which dwelt in such a body; so nobody did\ndoubt it, of course, except a few jaundiced and sceptical folk, who\nnever could be got to believe anything.\n\n\"Good-night, my love,\" said Mr Auberly, as the child placed the coffee\nbeside his chair, and then advanced, somewhat timidly, and held up her\ncheek to be kissed.\n\nThe upright man stooped, and there was a shade less of grimness in his\nsmile as his lips touched his daughter's pale cheek.\n\nLouisa, or, to use the name by which she was better known in the house,\nLoo, had clasped her hands tightly together while she was in the act of\nreceiving this tribute of parental affection, as if she were struggling\nto crush down some feeling, but the feeling, whatever it was, would not\nbe crushed down; it rose up and asserted itself by causing Loo to burst\ninto a passionate flood of tears, throw her arms round her father's\nneck, and hold him tight there while she kissed his cheek all over.\n\n\"Tut, tut, child!\" exclaimed Mr Auberly, endeavouring to re-arrange the\nstiff collar and cravat, which had been sadly disordered; \"you must\nreally try to get over these--there, don't be cast down,\" he added, in a\nkinder tone, patting Loo's head.  \"Good-night, dear; run away to bed\nnow, and be a good girl.\"\n\nLoo smiled faintly through her tears as she looked up at her father, who\nhad again become upright, said \"Good-night,\" and ran from the room with\na degree of energy that might have been the result of exuberant spirits,\nthough possibly it was caused by some other feeling.\n\nMr Auberly sat for some time, dividing his attentions pretty equally\nbetween the paper, the fire, and the coffee, until he recollected having\nreceived a letter that day which he had forgotten to answer, whereupon\nhe rose and sat down before his writing-table to reply.\n\nThe letter was from a poor widow, a sister-in-law of his own, who had\ndisgraced herself for ever--at least in Mr Auberly's eyes--by having\nmarried a waterman.  Mr Auberly shut his eyes obstinately to the fact\nthat the said waterman had, by the sheer force of intelligence, good\nconduct, courage, and perseverance, raised himself to the command of an\nEast Indiaman.  It is astonishing how firmly some people can shut their\neyes--sew them up, as it were, and plaster them over--to some things,\nand how easily they can open them to others!  Mr Auberly's eyes were\nopen only to the fact that his sister-in-law had married a waterman, and\nthat that was an unpardonable sin, for which she was for ever banished\nfrom the sunshine of his presence.\n\nThe widow's letter set forth that since her husband's death she had been\nin somewhat poor circumstances--though not in absolute poverty--for\nwhich she expressed herself thankful; that she did not write to ask for\nmoney, but that she had a young son--a boy of about twelve--whom she was\nvery anxious to get into a mercantile house of some sort, and, knowing\nhis great influence, etcetera, etcetera, she hoped that, forgetting, if\nnot forgiving, the past, now that her husband was dead, he would kindly\ndo what he could, etcetera, etcetera.\n\nTo this Mr Auberly replied that it was impossible to forgive the past,\nbut he would do his best to forget it, and also to procure a situation\nfor her son (though _certainly_ not in his own office), on one\nconsideration, namely, that she, the widow, should forget the past\nalso--including his own, Mr Auberly's, existence (as she had once\nbefore promised to do), and that she should never inform her son, or any\nother member of her family--if there happened to be any others members\nof it--of the relationship existing between them, nor apply to him by\nvisit or by letter for any further favours.  In the event of her\nagreeing to this arrangement, she might send her son to his residence in\nBeverly Square, on Thursday next, between eleven and twelve.\n\nJust as he concluded this letter a footman entered softly and laid a\nthree-cornered note on the table.\n\n\"Stay, Hopkins, I want you,\" said Mr Auberly, as he opened the note and\nran his eye over it.\n\nHopkins, who was clad in blue velvet and white stockings, stood like a\nmute beside his master's chair.  He was very tall and very thin, and\nvery red in the nose.\n\n\"Is the young woman waiting, Hopkins?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; she's in the lobby.\"\n\n\"Send her up.\"\n\nIn a few seconds Hopkins reopened the door, and looked down with\nmajestic condescension on a smart young girl whom he ushered into the\nroom.\n\n\"That will do; you may go--stay, post this letter.  Come here, young\nwoman.\"\n\nThe young woman, who was evidently a respectable servant-girl,\napproached with some timidity.\n\n\"Your name is Matty Merryon, I understand (yes, sir), at least so your\nlate mistress, Miss Tippet, informs me.  Pray, what does Matty stand\nfor?\"\n\n\"Martha, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, Martha, Miss Tippet gives you a very good character--which is\nwell, because I intend you to be servant to my child--her maid; but Miss\nTippet qualifies her remarks by saying that you are a little careless in\n_some_ things.  What things are you careless in?\"\n\n\"La! sir--\"\n\n\"You must not say \\`La!' my girl,\" interrupted Mr Auberly with a frown,\n\"nor use exclamations of any kind in my presence; what are the \\`some\nthings' referred to?\"\n\n\"Sure I don't know, sir,\" said the abashed Matty.  \"I s'pose there's\na-many things I ain't very good at; but, please, sir, I don't mean to do\nnothin' wrong, sir, I don't indeed; an' I'll try to serve you well, sir,\nif it wor only to plaaze my missis, as I'm leavin' against my will, for\nI love my--\"\n\n\"There, that will do,\" said Mr Auberly somewhat sternly, as the girl\nappeared to be getting excited.\n\n\"Ring that bell; now, go downstairs and Hopkins will introduce you to my\nhousekeeper, who will explain your duties to you.\"\n\nHopkins entered and solemnly marched Martha Merryon to the regions\nbelow.\n\nMr Auberly locked away his papers, pulled out his watch, wound it up,\nand then, lighting a bedroom candle, proceeded with much gravity\nupstairs.\n\nHe was a very stately-looking man, and strikingly dignified as he walked\nupstairs to his bedroom--slowly and deliberately, as though he were\nmarching at his own funeral to the tune of something even deader than\nthe \"Dead March in Saul.\"\n\nIt is almost a violation of propriety to _think_ of Mr Auberly doing\nsuch a very undignified thing as \"going to bed!\"  Yet truth requires us\nto tell that he did it; that he undressed himself as other mortals do;\nthat he clothed himself in the wonted ghostly garment; and that, when\nhis head was last seen--in the act of closing the curtains around him--\nthere was a conical white cap on it, tied with a string below the chin,\nand ornamented on the top with a little tassel, which waggled as though\nit were bidding a triumphant and final adieu to human dignity!\n\nHalf an hour later, Mrs Rose, the housekeeper, a matronly, good-looking\nwoman, with very red cheeks, was busy in the study explaining to Matty\nMerryon her duties.  She had already shown her all over the house, and\nwas now at the concluding lesson.\n\n\"Look here now, Merryon,\" began the housekeeper.\n\n\"Oh, please don't call me Merryon--I ain't used to it.  Call me Matty,\n_do_ now!\"\n\n\"Very well, Matty,\" continued Mrs Rose, with a smile, \"I've no\nobjection; you Irish are a strange race!  Now, look here.  This is\nmaster's study, and mind, he's very partikler, dreadful partikler.\"\n\nShe paused and looked at her pupil, as if desirous of impressing this\npoint deeply on her memory.\n\n\"He don't like his papers or books touched; not even dusted!  So you'll\nbe careful not to dust 'em, nor to touch 'em even so much as with your\nlittle finger, for he likes to find 'em in the mornin' just as he left\n'em at night.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mrs Rose,\" said Matty, who was evidently giving up her whole soul\nto the instruction that was being imparted.\n\n\"Now,\" continued the housekeeper, \"the arranging of this room will be\nyour last piece of work at night.  You'll just come in, rake out the\ngrate, carry off the ashes, lay the noo fire, put the matches handy on\nthe chimney-piece, look round to see that all's right, and then turn off\nthe gas.  The master is a early riser, and lights the fire his-self of a\nmornin'.\"\n\n\"Yes, 'm,\" said Matty, with a courtesy.\n\n\"Now, go and do it,\" said Mrs Rose, \"that I may see you understand it.\nBegin with the grate an' the ashes.\"\n\nMatty, who was in truth an experienced maid-of-all-work, began with\nalacrity to discharge the duties of her new station.  She carried off\nthe ashes, and returned with the materials for next day's fire in a\nshovel.  Here she gave a slight indication of her so-called carelessness\n(awkwardness would have been more appropriate) by letting two or three\npieces of stick and a bit of coal fall on the carpet, in her passage\nacross the room.\n\n\"Be careful, Matty,\" said Mrs Rose gently.  \"It's all owin' to haste.\nTake your time, an' you won't do such things.\"\n\nMatty apologised, picked up the materials, and laid the fire.  Then she\ntook her apron and approached the writing-table, evidently with the\nintention of taking the dust off the corners, but not by any means\nintending to touch the books or papers.\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Mrs Rose sternly.\n\nMatty stopped with a guilty look.\n\n\"Not a touch,\" said Mrs Rose.\n\n\"Not even the edges, nor the legs?\" inquired the pupil.\n\n\"Neither edges nor legs,\" said the instructor.\n\n\"Sure it could do no harm.\"\n\n\"Matty,\" said Mrs Rose solemnly, \"the great thing that your\ncountrywomen have to learn is _obedience_.\"\n\n\"Thank 'ee, 'm,\" said Matty, who, being overawed by the housekeeper's\nsolemnity, felt confused, and was uncertain whether the reference to her\ncountrywomen was complimentary or the reverse.\n\n\"Now,\" continued Mrs Rose, \"the matches.\"\n\nMatty placed the box of matches on the chimney-piece.\n\n\"Very well; now you've got to look round to see that all's right.\"\n\nMatty looked round on the dark portraits that covered the walls\n(supposed to be ancestors), on the shelves of books, great and small,\nnew and old (supposed to be read); on the vases, statuettes, chairs,\ntables, desks, curtains, papers, etcetera, etcetera, and, being utterly\nignorant of what constituted right and what wrong in reference to such\nthings, finally turned her eyes on Mrs Rose with an innocent smile.\n\n\"Don't you see that the shutters are neither shut nor barred, Matty?\"\n\nShe had _not_ seen this, but she at once went and closed and barred\nthem, in which operation she learned, first, that the bars refused to\nreceive their respective \"catches,\" with unyielding obstinacy for some\ntime; and, second, that they suddenly gave in without rhyme or reason\nand pinched her fingers severely.\n\n\"Now then, what next?\" inquired Mrs Rose.\n\n\"Put out the gas,\" suggested Matty.\n\n\"And leave yourself in the dark,\" said the housekeeper, in a tone of\nplayful irony.\n\n\"Ah! sure, didn't I forgit the candle!\"\n\nIn order to rectify this oversight, Matty laid the unlighted candle\nwhich she had brought with her to the room on the writing-table, and\ngoing to the chimney-piece, returned with the match-box.\n\n\"Be careful now, Matty,\" said Mrs Rose earnestly.  \"There's nothink\nI've such a fear of as fire.  You can't be too careful.\"\n\nThis remark made Matty, who was of an anxious temperament, extremely\nnervous.  She struck the match hesitatingly, and lighted the candle\nshakily.  Of course it would not light (candles never do on such\noccasions), and a long red-hot end of burnt wood projected from the\npoint of the match.\n\n\"Don't let the burnt end drop into the wastepaper basket!\" exclaimed\nMrs Rose, in an unfortunate moment.\n\n\"Where?\" exclaimed Matty with a start that sent the red-hot end into the\ncentre of a mass of papers.\n\n\"There, just at your feet; don't be so nervous, girl!\" cried Mrs Rose.\n\nMatty, in her anxiety not to drop the match, at once dropped it into the\nwaste-paper basket, which was instantly alight.  A stamp of the foot\nmight have extinguished it, but this did not occur to either of the\ndomestics.  The housekeeper, who was a courageous woman, seized the\nbasket in both hands and rushed with it to the fireplace, thereby\nfanning the flame into a blaze and endangering her dress and curls.  She\nsucceeded, however, in cramming the basket and its contents into the\ngrate; then the two, with the aid of poker, tongs, and shovel, crushed\nand beat out the fire.\n\n\"There!  I said you'd do it,\" gasped Mrs Rose, as she flung herself,\npanting, into Mr Auberly's easy-chair; \"this comes of bein' in a\nhurry.\"\n\n\"I was always unfort'nit,\" sighed Matty, still holding the shovel and\nkeeping her eye on the grate, as if ready to make a furious attack on\nthe smallest spark that should venture to show itself.\n\n\"Come, now, we'll go to bed,\" said Mrs Rose, rising, \"but first look\nwell round to see that all is safe.\"\n\nA thorough and most careful investigation was made of the basket, the\ngrate, and the carpet surrounding the fireplace, but nothing beyond the\nsmell of the burnt papers could be discovered, so the instructor and\npupil put out the gas, shut the door, and retired to the servants'-hall,\nwhere Hopkins, the cook, the housemaid, and a small maid-of-all-work\nawaited their arrival--supper being already on the table.\n\nHere Mrs Rose entertained the company with a graphic--not to say\nexaggerated--account of the \"small fire\" in the study, and wound up with\nan eloquent appeal to all to \"beware of fire,\" and an assurance that\nthere was nothing on the face of the whole earth that she had a greater\nhorror of.\n\nMeanwhile the \"little spark\" among the papers--forgotten in the\nexcitement of the succeeding blaze of the waste-paper basket--continued\nto do its slow but certain work.  Having fallen on the cloth between two\nbundles, it smouldered until it reached a cotton pen-wiper, which\nreceived it rather greedily in its embrace.  This pen-wiper lay in\ncontact with some old letters which were dry and tindery in their\nnature, and, being piled closely together in a heap, afforded enlarged\naccommodation, for the \"spark,\" which in about half an hour became quite\nworthy of being termed a \"swell.\"\n\nAfter that things went on like--\"like a house on fire\"--if we may\nventure to use that too often misapplied expression, in reference to the\nelegant mansion in Beverly Square on that raw November night.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO.\n\nANOTHER LITTLE \"SPARK.\"\n\nWhistling is a fine, free, manly description of music, which costs\nlittle and expresses much.\n\nIn all its phases, whistling is an interesting subject of study; whether\nwe regard its aptitude for expressing personal independence,\nrecklessness, and jollity; its antiquity--having begun no doubt with\nAdam--or its modes of production; as, when created grandly by the\nwhistling gale, or exasperatingly by the locomotive, or gushingly by the\nlark, or sweetly by the little birds that \"warble in the flowering\nthorn.\"\n\nThe peculiar phase of this time-honoured music to which we wish to draw\nthe reader's attention at present, is that which was exemplified one\nNovember night (the same November night of which mention has been made\nin the previous chapter) by a small boy who, in his progress through the\nstreets of London, was arrested suddenly under the shadow of St. Paul's\nby the bright glare and the tempting fare of a pastry-cook's window.\n\nBeing hungry, the small boy, thrusting his cold hands deep into his\nempty trouser-pockets, turned his fat little face and round blue eyes\nfull on the window, and stared at the tarts and pies like a famishing\nowl.  Being poor--so poor that he possessed not the smallest coin of the\nrealm--he stared in vain; and, being light of heart as well as stout of\nlimb, he relieved his feelings by whistling at the food with\ninexpressible energy.\n\nThe air selected by the young musician was Jim Crow--a sable melody high\nin public favour at that time--the familiar strains of which he\ndelivered with shrill and tuneful precision, which intensified as he\ncontinued to gaze, until they rose above the din of cabs, vans, and\n'busses; above the house-tops, above the walls of the great cathedral,\nand finally awakened the echoes of its roof, which, coming out, from the\ncrevices and cornices where they usually slept, went dancing upwards on\nthe dome, and played around the golden cross that glimmered like a ghost\nin the dark wintry sky.\n\nThe music also awakened the interest of a tall policeman whose beat that\nnight chanced to be St. Paul's Churchyard.  That sedate guardian of the\nnight, observing that the small boy slightly impeded the thoroughfare,\nsauntered up to him, and just as he reached that point in the chorus\nwhere Mr Crow is supposed to wheel and turn himself about, spun him\nround and gave him a gentle rap on the head with his knuckles, at the\nsame time advising him to move on.\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed the small boy, looking up with an expression of deep\nconcern on his countenance, as he backed off the pavement, \"I _hope_ I\ndidn't hurt you, bobby; I _really_ didn't mean to; but accidents will\nhappen, you know, an' if you won't keep your knuckles out of a feller's\nway, why--\"\n\n\"Come,\" muttered the policeman, \"shut up your potato-trap for fear you\ncatch cold.  Your mother wants you; she's got some pap ready for you.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" exclaimed the small boy, with his head a little on one side, as\nthough he were critically inspecting the portrait of some curious\nanimal, \"a prophet it is--a blue-coated prophet in brass buttons, all\nbut choked with a leather stock--if not conceit.  A horacle, six fut two\nin its stockin's.  I say, bobby, whoever brought you up carried you up\nmuch too high, both in body and notions.  Wot _wouldn't_ they give for\n'im in the Guards, or the hoss-marines, if he was only eight inches\nwider across the shoulders!\"\n\nSeeing that the policeman passed slowly and gravely on without\ncondescending to take further notice of him, the small boy bade him an\naffectionate farewell; said that he would not forget to mention him\nfavourably at head-quarters, and then continued his progress through the\ncrowded streets at a smart pace, whistling Jim Crow at the top of his\nshrill pipe.\n\nThe small boy had a long walk before him; but neither his limbs,\nspirits, nor lips grew weary by the way.  Indeed, his energies seemed to\nincrease with every step, if one might judge from the easy swagger of\nhis gait, and the various little touches of pleasantry in which he\nindulged from time to time; such as pulling the caps over the eyes of\nboys smaller than himself, winking at those who were bigger, uttering\nIndian war-whoops down alleys and lanes that looked as if they could\necho, and chaffing all who appeared to be worthy of his attentions.\nThose eccentricities of humour, however, did not divert his active mind\nfrom the frequent and earnest study of the industrial arts, as these\nwere exhibited and exemplified in shop-windows.\n\n\"Jolly stuff that, ain't it?\" observed another small boy, in a coat much\ntoo long for him, as they met and stopped in front of a chocolate-shop\nat the top of Holborn Hill, where a steam-engine was perpetually\ngrinding up such quantities of rich brown chocolate, that it seemed\nquite unreasonable, selfish, and dog-in-the-manger-ish of the young man\nbehind the counter to stand there, and neither eat it himself, nor let\nanyone else touch it.\n\n\"Yes, it's very jolly stuff,\" replied the first small boy, regarding his\nquestioner sternly.  \"I know you'd like some, wouldn't you?  Go in now\nan' buy two pen'orth, and I'll buy the half from you w'en you come out.\"\n\n\"_Walker_!\" replied the boy in the long coat.\n\n\"Just so; and I'd advise you to become a walker too,\" retorted the\nother; \"run away now, your master's bin askin' after you for half an\nhour, _I_ know, and more.\"\n\nWithout waiting for a reply, the small boy (our small boy) swaggered\naway whistling louder than ever.\n\nPassing along Holborn, he continued his way into Oxford Street, where\nthe print-shop windows proved irresistibly attractive.  They seemed also\nto have the effect of stimulating his intellectual and conceptive\nfaculties, insomuch that he struck out several new, and, to himself,\nhighly entertaining pieces of pleasantry, one of which consisted of\nasking a taciturn cabman, in the meekest of voices:\n\n\"Please, sir, you couldn't tell me wot's o'clock, could you?\"\n\nThe cabman observed a twinkle in the boy's eye; saw through him; in a\nmetaphorical sense, and treated him with silent contempt.\n\n\"Oh, I beg pardon, sir,\" continued the small boy, in the same meek tone,\nas he turned to move humbly away; \"I forgot to remember that cabbies\ndon't carry no watches, no, nor _change_ neither, they're much too wide\nawake for that!\"\n\nA sudden motion of the taciturn cabman caused the small boy to dart\nsuddenly to the other side of the crowded street, where he resumed his\neasy independent air, and his interrupted tune.\n\n\"Can you direct me to Nottin' Hill Gate, missus?\" he inquired of an\napplewoman, on reaching the neighbourhood of Tottenham Court Road.\n\n\"Straight on as you go, boy,\" answered the woman, who was busying\nherself about her stall.\n\n\"Very good indeed,\" said the small boy, with a patronising air; \"quite\ncorrectly answered.  You've learnt geography, I see.\"\n\n\"What say?\" inquired the woman, who was apparently a little deaf.\n\n\"I was askin' the price o' your oranges, missus.\"\n\n\"One penny apiece,\" said the woman, taking up one.\n\n\"They ain't biled to make 'em puff out, are they?\"\n\nTo this the woman vouchsafed no reply.\n\n\"Come, missus, don't be cross; wot's the price o' yer apples now?\"\n\n\"D'you want one?\" asked the woman testily.\n\n\"Of course I does.\"\n\n\"Well, then, they're two a penny.\"\n\n\"Two a penny!\" cried the small boy, with a look of surprise; \"why, I'd\n'a said they was a penny apiece.  Good evenin', missus; I never buys\ncheap fruit--cheap and nasty--no, no; good evenin'.\"\n\nIt seemed as if the current of the small boy's thoughts had been\ndiverted by this conversation, for he walked for some time with his eyes\ncast on the ground, and without whistling, but whatever the feelings\nwere that might have been working in his mind, they were speedily put to\nflight by a facetious butcher, who pulled his hat over his eyes as he\npassed him.\n\n\"Now then, pig-sticker, what d'ye mean by that?\" he shouted, but as the\nbutcher walked on without deigning to reply, he let off his indignation\nby yelling in at the open door of a tobacco-shop and making off at a\nbrisk run.\n\nFrom this point in his progress, he became still more hilarious and\ndaring in his freaks, and turned aside once or twice into narrow\nstreets, where sounds of shouting or of music promised him fresh\nexcitement.\n\nOn turning the corner of one of those streets, he passed a wide doorway,\nby the side of which was a knob with the word FIRE in conspicuous\nletters above it, and the word BELL below it.  The small boy paused,\ncaught his breath as if a sudden thought had struck him, and glanced\nround.  The street was comparatively quiet; his heart beat high; he\nseized the bell with both hands, pulled it full out, and bolted!\n\nNow it chanced that one of the firemen of the station happened to be\nstanding close to the door, inside, at the time.  He, guessing the\nmeaning of the ring at once, darted out and gave chase.\n\nThe small boy fled on the wings of terror, with his blue eyes starting\nfrom their sockets.  The fireman was tall and heavy, but he was also\nstrong and in his prime, so that a short run brought him up with the\nfugitive, whom he seized with a grip of iron.\n\n\"Now, then, young bottle-imp, what did you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Oh! please, sir,\" gasped the small boy, with a beseeching look, \"I\n_couldn't_ help it.\"\n\nThere was such a tone of truthfulness in this \"_couldn't_\" that it\ntickled the fireman.  His mouth relaxed in a quiet smile, and, releasing\nhis intended victim, he returned to the station, while the small boy\ndarted away in the direction of Oxford Street.\n\nHe had scarcely reached the end of the street, however, when a man\nturned the corner at full speed and ran him down--ran him down so\ncompletely that he sent him head-over-heels into the kennel, and,\npassing on, darted at the fire-bell of the station, which he began to\npull violently.\n\nThe man was tall and dishevelled, partially clad in blue velvet, with\nstockings which had once been white, but were now covered from garter to\ntoe with mud.  One shoe clung to his left foot, the other was fixed by\nthe heel in a grating over a cellar-window in Tottenham Court Road.\nWithout hat or coat, with his shirt-sleeves torn by those unfortunates\ninto whose arms he had wildly rushed, with his hair streaming backwards,\nhis eyes blood-shot, his face pale as marble, and perspiration running\ndown his cheeks, not even his own most intimate friends would have\nrecognised Hopkins--the staid, softspoken, polite, and gentle Hopkins--\nhad they seen him that night pulling like a maniac at the fire-bell.\n\nAnd, without doubt, Hopkins _was_ a maniac that night--at least he was\nafflicted with temporary insanity!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THREE.\n\nFIRE!!!\n\n\"Hallo, that'll do, man!\" cried the same stalwart fireman who had seized\nthe small boy, stepping out and laying his hand on Hopkins's shoulder,\nwhereabouts is it?\n\nHopkins heard him not.  One idea had burnt itself into the poor man's\nbrain, and that was the duty that lay on him to ring the alarm-bell!\nSeeing this, the fireman seized him, and dragged him forcibly--almost\nlifted him--into the station, round the door of which an eager crowd had\nalready begun to collect.\n\n\"Calm yourself,\" said the stalwart fireman quietly, as he thrust Hopkins\ndown into a chair.  \"Consider now.  You'll make us too late if you don't\nspeak.  Where is it?\"\n\n\"B-B-Fire!\" yelled Hopkins, gasping, and glaring round him on the men,\nwho were quietly putting on their helmets.\n\nHopkins suddenly burst from the grasp of his captor, and, rushing out,\nseized the bell-handle, which he began to pull more furiously than ever.\n\n\"Get her out, Jim,\" said the fireman in a low tone to one of his\ncomrades (\"her\" being the engine); at the same time he went to the door,\nand again seizing Hopkins, brought him back and forced him into a chair,\nwhile he said firmly:\n\n\"Now, then, out with it, man; where's the fire?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" screamed Hopkins, \"fire! fire that's it!  B-!  B-Beverly!--\nblazes!--square!--number--Fire!\"\n\n\"That'll do,\" said the fireman, at once releasing the temporary maniac,\nand going to a book where he calmly made an entry of the name of the\nsquare, the hour of the night, and the nature of the call.  Two lines\nsufficed.  Then he rose, put on his helmet, and thrust a small hatchet\ninto his belt, just as the engine was dragged to the door of the\nstation.\n\nThere was something absolutely magnificent in this scene which no pen\ncan describe, because more than half its force was conveyed only by the\neye and the ear.  The strong contrast between human excitement and\nmadness coupled with imbecility, and human calmness and self-possession\ncoupled with vigorous promptitude, was perfect.\n\nJust before poor Hopkins rang his first note of alarm the station had\nbeen wrapt in profound silence--the small boy's interruption having been\nbut a momentary affair.  George Dale, the fireman in charge, was seated\nat a desk in the watch-room (known among firemen as the \"lobby\"), making\nan entry in a diary.  All the other men--about thirteen in number--had\ngone to their respective homes and beds in the immediate neighbourhood,\nwith the exception of the two whose turn it was to remain on duty all\nnight.  These two (named Baxmore and Corney), with their coats, belts,\nboots, and caps on, had just lain down on two low tressel couches, and\nwere courting sleep.  The helmets of their comrades hung on the walls\nround the room, with belts and hatchets underneath them.  Several pairs\nof boots also graced the walls, and a small clock, whose gentle tick was\nthe only sound that broke the silence of the night.  In an outer room\nthe dim form of a spare engine could be seen through the doorway.\n\nThe instant that the bell rang, however, this state of quietude was put\nto flight.  The two men rose from their couches, and Dale stepped to the\ndoor.  There was no starting up, no haste in their movements, yet there\nwas prompt rapidity.  The men, having been sailors, had been trained in\nthe midst of alarms.  The questions which were put to Hopkins, as above\ndescribed, were rapidly uttered.  Before they were answered the two men\nwere ready, and at Dale's order, \"Get her out!\" they both vanished.\n\nOne ran round the corner to the engine-house and \"knocked up\" the driver\nin passing.  The other ran from door to door of the firemen's abodes,\nwhich were close at hand, and with a loud double-ring summoned the\nsleepers.  Before he got back to help the first with the engine, one and\nanother and another door opened, and a man darted out, buttoning braces\nor coat as he ran.  Each went into the station, seized his helmet, belt,\nand axe, from his own peg, and in another moment all were armed\n_cap-a-pie_.  At the same instant that the engine appeared at the door a\npair of horses were trotted up.  Two men held them; two others fastened\nthe traces; the driver sprang to his seat; the others leaped to their\nrespective places.  Each knew what to do, and did it at once.  There was\nno hurry, no loss of time, no excitement; some of the men, even while\nacting with the utmost vigour and promptitude, were yawning away their\ndrowsiness; and in less than ten minutes from the moment the bell first\nrang the whip cracked and the fire-engine dashed away from the station\namid the cheers of the crowd.\n\nIt may be as well to remark here in passing, that the London Fire\nBrigade had, at the time of which we write, reached a high state of\nefficiency, although it could not stand comparison with the perfection\nof system and unity of plan which mark the organisation and conduct of\nthe Brigade of the present day.\n\nMr Braidwood, the able Superintendent, had for many years been training\nhis men on a system, the original of which he had begun and proved in\nEdinburgh.  Modifying his system to suit the peculiarities of the larger\nfield to which he had been translated, he had brought the \"Fire Engine\nEstablishment,\" (which belonged at that time to several insurance\ncompanies) to a state of efficiency which rendered it a model and a\ntraining-school for the rest of the world; and although he had not the\nadvantage of the telegraph or the powerful aid of the land steam\nfire-engine of the present day, he had men of the same metal as those\nwhich compose the force now.\n\nThe \"Metropolitan Fire Brigade,\" as it then existed under the control of\nthe Metropolitan Board of Works, had been carried by its chief, Captain\nEyre Massey Shaw, to a condition of efficiency little if at all short of\nperfection, its only fault being (if we may humbly venture a remark)\nthat it was too small both in numbers of engines and men.\n\nNow, good reader, if you have never seen a London fire-engine go to a\nfire, you have no conception of what it is; and even if you have seen\nit, but have not gone with it, still you have no idea of what it is.\n\nTo those accustomed to it, no doubt, it may be tame enough--we cannot\ntell; but to those who mount an engine for the first time and drive\nthrough the crowded thoroughfares of London at a wild tearing gallop, it\nis probably the most exciting drive conceivable.  It beats\nsteeple-chasing.  It feels like driving to destruction--so wild and so\nreckless is it.  And yet it is not reckless in the strict sense of that\nword; for there is a stern _need-be_ in the case.  Every _moment_ (not\nto mention minutes or hours) is of the utmost importance in the progress\nof a fire.  Fire smoulders and creeps at first, it may be, but when it\nhas got the mastery, and bursts into flames, it flashes to its work and\ncompletes it quickly.  At such times, one moment of time lost may\ninvolve thousands of pounds--ay, and many human lives!  This is well\nknown to those whose profession it is to fight the flames.  Hence the\nunion of apparent mad desperation, with cool, quiet self-possession in\ntheir proceedings.  When firemen can work in silence they do so.  No\nunnecessary word is uttered, no voice is needlessly raised.  Like the\nmovements of some beautiful steam-engine, which, with oiled pistons,\ncranks, and levers, does its unobtrusive work in its own little chamber\nin comparative stillness, yet with a power that would tear and rend to\npieces buildings and machinery, so the firemen sometimes bend to their\nwork quietly, though with mind and muscles strung to the utmost point of\ntension.  At other times, like the roaring locomotive crashing through a\ntunnel or past a station, their course is a tumultuous rush, amid a\nstorm of shouting and gesticulation.\n\nSo was it on the present occasion.  Had the fire been distant, they\nwould have had to commence their gallop somewhat leisurely, for fear of\nbreaking down the horses; but it was not far off--not much more than a\ncouple of miles--so they dashed round the corner of their own street at\na brisk trot, and swept into Oxford Street.  Here they broke into a\ngallop, and here the noise of their progress began, for the great\nthoroughfare was crowded with vehicles and pedestrians, many of whom\nwere retiring from the theatres and music-halls, and other places of\nentertainment.\n\nTo pass through such a crowd without coming into collision with anything\nrequired not only the most dexterous driving, but rendered it necessary\nthat some of the men on the engine should stand up and shout, or rather\nroar incessantly, as they whirled along, clearing everything out of\ntheir way, and narrowly escaping innumerable crashes by a mere\nhairbreadth.\n\nThe men, as we said before, having been sailors, seemed to shout with\nthe memory of the boatswain strong upon them, for their tones were\npitched in the deepest and gruffest bass-key.  Sometimes there was a\nlull for a moment, as a comparatively clear space of a hundred yards or\nso lay before them; then their voices rose like the roaring of the gale\nas a stupid or deaf cabman got in their way, or a plethoric 'bus\nthreatened to interrupt their furious passage.\n\nThe cross streets were the points where the chief difficulties met them.\nThere the cab and van drivers turned into or crossed the great\nthoroughfare, all ignorant of the thunderbolt that was rushing on like a\nfiery meteor, with its lamps casting a glare of light before, and the\nhelmets of its stern charioteers flashing back the rays of street-lamps\nand windows; for, late though the hour was, all the gin-palaces, and\ntobacconists' shops, and many of the restaurants were still open and\nbrightly illuminated.\n\nAt the corner of Wells Street, the crowd of cabs and other vehicles was\nso great that the driver of the engine began to tighten his reins, and\nJim Baxmore and Joe Corney raised their voices to a fierce shout.  Cabs,\n'busses, and pedestrians scattered right and left in a marvellous\nmanner; the driver slackened his reins, cracked his whip, and the horses\nstretched out again.\n\nIn passing Berners Street, a hansom cab swept round the corner, its\ndashing driver smoking a cigar in sublime self-satisfaction, and looking\ncarelessly right and left for a \"fare.\"  This exquisite almost ran into\nthe engine!  There was a terrific howl from all the firemen; the cabby\nturned his smart horse with a bound to one side, and lost his cigar in\nthe act--in reference to which misfortune he was heartily congratulated\nby a small member of the Shoe-black Brigade,--while the engine went\nsteadily and sternly on its way.\n\n\"There, it shows a light,\" observed one of the firemen to Dale, as he\npointed to a luminous appearance in the sky away to the north-east.\n\nDale was already looking in that direction, and made no reply.\n\nAs they reached Tottenham Court Road the driver again checked the pace a\nlittle; yet even at the reduced speed they passed everything like a\nwhirlwind.  The traffic here was so great that it behoved them to be\nmore cautious.  Of course, the more need that there was for caution, the\nmore necessity was there for shouting; and the duty of Baxmore and\nCorney--standing as they did in front of their comrades beside the\ndriver--became severe, but they had good lungs both of them!\n\nAt the point where Tottenham Court Road cuts Oxford Street, the\naccumulation of vehicles of all sorts, from a hand-barrow to a\nfurniture-van, is usually very great.  To one unaccustomed to the powers\nof London drivers, it would have seemed nothing short of madness to\ndrive full tilt into the mass that blocked the streets at this point.\nBut the firemen did it.  They reined up a little, it is true, just as a\nhunter does in gathering his horse together for a rush at a stone wall,\nbut there was nothing like an approach to stopping.\n\n\"Hi!  Hi!!  Hi!!!\" roared the firemen, Baxmore and Corney high above the\nrest.  A 'bus lumbered to the left just in time; a hansom sprang to the\nright, not a moment too soon; a luggage-van bolted into Crown Street;\nthe pedestrians scattered right and left, and the way was clear--no, not\nquite clear!  The engine had to turn at a right angle here into\nTottenham Court Road.  Round it went on the two off-wheels, and came\nfull swing on a market-gardener and a hot-coffee woman, who were\nwheeling their respective barrows leisurely side by side, and chatting\nas they went.\n\nThe roar that burst from the firemen was terrific.  The driver attempted\nboth to pull up and to turn aside.  The market-gardener dropt his barrow\nand fled.  The hot-coffee woman, being of a resolute nature, thrust her\nbarrow by main force on the footpath, and so saved her goods and herself\nby a hairbreadth, while the barrow of her friend was knocked in pieces.\nBut the effort of the engine-driver to avoid this had well-nigh resulted\nin serious consequences.  In endeavouring to clear the market-gardener\nhe drew so near to the footpath that in another moment a lamp-post would\nhave been carried away, and the wheels of the engine, in all\nprobability, knocked off, had not Joe Corney observed the danger.\n\nWith a truly Irish yell Joe seized the rein next him, and pulled the\nhorses round almost at a right angle.  The nave of the hind-wheel just\nshaved the post as it flew by.  The whole thing passed so swiftly that\nbefore the market-gardener recovered from his consternation the engine\nwas only discernible in the distance by the sparks that flew from its\nwheels as it held on in its furious way.\n\nAll along its course a momentary disturbance of London equanimity was\ncreated.  Families not yet abed rushed to their front windows, and,\nlooking out, exclaimed, \"Ha! the firemen.\"  Tipplers in gin-palaces ran\nto the doors and said, \"There they go\", \"That's your sort\", \"Hurrah, my\nhearties!\" or, \"Go it, ye cripples!\" according to the different stages\nof inebriation at which they had arrived; and belated men of business\nstopped to gaze, and then resumed their way with thoughts and\nspeculations on fire and fire insurance, more or less deep and serious\naccording to temperament.  But the disturbance was only temporary.  The\nfamilies retired to their suppers or beds, the tipplers returned to\ntheir tipple, the belated speculators to their dreams, and in a few\nminutes (no doubt) forgot what they had seen, and forgot; perchance,\nthat they had any personal interest in fire raising, or fire extinction,\nor fire prevention, or fire in any dangerous shape or form whatever, or\nindulged in the comforting belief, mayhap, that whatever disasters might\nattend the rest of the London community, they and their houses being\nendued with the properties of the salamander, nothing in the shape of\nfire might, could, would, or should kindle upon them.  So true is it\nthat, \"all men think all men mortal but themselves!\"\n\nDo you doubt this, reader?  If so, go poll your acquaintance, and tell\nus how many of them have got rope-ladders, or even ropes, to escape from\ntheir houses should they take fire; how many of them have got\nhand-pumps, or even buckets, placed so as to be handy in case of fire;\nand how many of them have got their houses and furniture insured against\nfire.\n\nMeanwhile, the fire-engine held on its way, until it turned into Beverly\nSquare, and pulled short up in front of the blazing mansion of James\nAuberly, Esquire.\n\nAnother engine was already at work there.  It had come from a nearer\nstation, of the existence of which Hopkins had been ignorant when he set\nout on his wild race for help.  The men of this engine were already\ndoing their work quietly, but with perceptible effect, pouring incessant\nstreams of water in at the blazing windows, and watching for the\nslightest lull in the ferocity of the smoke and flame to attack the\nenemy at closer quarters.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOUR.\n\nA FIERCE FIGHT WITH THE FLAMES.\n\nWhen the small boy--whose name, it may be as well to mention, was\nWilliam (_alias_ Willie) Willders--saw the fire-engine start, as has\nbeen already described, his whole soul yearned to follow it, for, in the\ncourse of his short life, he had never succeeded in being at the\nbeginning of a fire, although he had often been at the middle and end of\none--not a very difficult thing in London, by the way, seeing that there\nare, on the average, between four and five fires every twenty-four\nhours!\n\nWillie Willders was of an enquiring disposition.  He wanted to know how\nthings were managed at a fire, from the beginning to the end, and he\nfound that the course of true inquiry, like another course we wot of,\nnever did run smooth.\n\nPoor Willie's heart was with that engine, but his legs were not.  They\ndid their best, but they failed, strong and active though they were, to\nkeep up with the horses.  So Willie heaved a bursting sigh and slackened\nhis speed--as he had often done before in similar circumstances--\nresolving to keep it in sight as long as he could, and trust to his\neyesight and to the flames \"showing a light\" for the rest.\n\nJust as he came to this magnanimous resolve, a strapping young gentleman\ncalled a passing cab, leaped in, ordered the driver to follow the\nengine, and offered double fare if he should keep it in view up to the\nfire.\n\nWillie, being sharp as a needle, at once stepped forward and made as\nthough he would open the door for the gentleman.  The youth was already\nin and the door shut, but he smiled as he shouted to the driver, \"All\nright!\" and tossed a copper to Willie, with the remark, \"There, you\nscamp!\"  The copper fell in the mud, and there Willie left it, as he\ndoubled nimbly behind the vehicle, and laid hold of it.\n\nThe cabman did his best to earn his double fare, and thus it came to\npass that Willie was in time to see the firemen commencing work.\n\nAs the young man leaped from the cab he uttered a cry of surprise and\nalarm, and rushed towards the crowd of firemen nearest to the burning\nhouse without paying his fare.  Willie was a little astonished at this,\nbut losing sight of the youth in the crowd, and seeing nothing more of\nhim at that time, he became engrossed in other matters.\n\nThere were so many men on the ground, however--for just then a third\nengine dashed up to the scene of conflagration--that it was difficult\nfor the excited boy to appreciate fully what he saw.  He got as close to\nthe engine, however, as the policemen would allow him, and observed that\na fire-plug had been already opened, and over it had been placed a\ncanvas cistern of about a yard long by eighteen inches broad, stretched\non an iron frame.  The cistern was filled with water to overflowing, and\nthe first engine had placed its suction-pipe in it, while from the front\nof the engine extended the leathern hose that conveyed the water to the\nburning house.\n\nWillie was deeply interested in this, and was endeavouring to solve\ncertain knotty points in his own mind, when they were suddenly solved\nfor him by a communicative dustman who stood in the crowd close by, and\nthus expounded the matter to his inquisitive son.\n\n\"You see, Tommy, the use o' the cistern is hobvious.  See, here's 'ow it\nlies.  If an ingin comes up an screwges its suction on to the plug, all\nthe other ingins as comes after it has to stan' by an' do nuffin.  But\nby puttin' the cistern over the plug an' lettin' it fill, another ingin\nor mabbe two more, can ram in its suction and drink away till it's fit\nto burst, d'ye see.\"\n\nWillie drank in the information with avidity, and then turned his\nattention to the front of the engine, to which several lengths of hose,\neach forty feet long, had been attached.  Baxmore and Corney were at the\nextreme end, screwing on the \"branch\" or nozzle by which the stream of\nwater is directed, and Dale was tumbling a half-drunk and riotous navvy\nhead-over-heels into the crowd, in order to convince him that his\nservices to pump were not wanted--a sufficient number having been\nprocured.  A couple of policemen walked this navvy quietly from the\nscene, as Dale called out:\n\n\"Down with her, boys!\"\n\n\"Pump away, lads!\" said one of the firemen, interpreting.\n\nThe volunteers bent their backs, and the white clouds of steam that\nissued from the burning house showed that the second engine was doing\nits work well.\n\nImmediately after, Dale and his men, with the exception of those\nrequired to attend the engine and the \"branch,\" were ordered to get out\nthe ladders.\n\nHe who gave this order was a tall, sinewy man, middle-aged apparently,\nand of grave demeanour.  His dress was similar to that of the other\nfiremen, but there was an air of quiet unobtrusive authority about him,\nwhich showed that he was a leader.\n\n\"We might get on the roof now, Mr Braidwood,\" suggested Dale, touching\nhis helmet as he addressed the well-known chief of the London\nFire-Engine Establishment.\n\n\"Not yet, Dale, not yet,\" said Braidwood; \"get inside and see if you can\ntouch the fire through the drawing-room floor.  It's just fallen in.\"\n\nDale and his men at once entered the front door of the building,\ndragging the branch and hose along with them, and were lost in smoke.\n\nPrevious to the arrival of the fire-engines, however, a scene had been\nenacted which Willie Willders had not witnessed.  A fire-escape was\nfirst to reach the burning house.  This was then, and still is, usually\nthe case, owing to the fact that escapes are far more numerous in London\nthan engines, so that the former, being always close at hand, often\naccomplish their great work of saving life before the engines make their\nappearance.\n\nThe escape in the immediate neighbourhood of Beverly Square was under\nthe charge of Conductor Samuel Forest, a man who, although young, had\nalready saved many lives, in the service of the Society for the\nProtection of Life from Fire.\n\nWhen Forest reached the field of action, Mr James Auberly was seen at\nan upper window in a state of undignified _dishabille_, shouting for\nhelp, and half suffocated with smoke, with Mrs Rose hanging round his\nneck on one side and Matty Merryon at the other.  Poor Auberly, having\ntried the staircase on the first alarm, was driven back by smoke, and\nrushed wildly to the window, where the two domestics, descending in\nterror from their attic, clung to him and rendered him powerless.\n\nForest at once pitched his escape--which was just a huge\nscientifically-constructed ladder, set on wheels.  The head of it\nreached to the windows of the second floor.  By pulling a rope attached\nto a lever, he raised a second ladder of smaller size, which was fitted\nto the head of the large one.  The top of this second ladder was nearly\nsixty feet from the ground, and it reached the window at which Mr\nAuberly was still shouting.  Forest at once sprang up.\n\n\"Leave me; save the women,\" gasped Auberly, as a man entered the room,\nbut the dense smoke overpowered him as he spoke, and he fell forward.\nThe women also sank to the ground.\n\nForest instantly seized Mrs Rose in his powerful arms, and hurrying\ndown the ladder to the top of the escape, put her into the canvas trough\nor sack which was suspended below the ladder all the way.  Down this she\nslid somewhat violently but safely to the ground, while Forest ran up\nagain and rescued Matty in the same way.  Mr Auberly was more difficult\nto manage, being a heavy man, and his rescuer was almost overpowered by\nthe thick smoke in the midst of which all this was done.  He succeeded,\nhowever, but fainted on reaching the ground.\n\nIt was at this point that the first engine arrived, and only a few\nminutes elapsed when the second made its appearance, followed by the cab\nfrom which the young man leapt with the exclamation of surprise and\nalarm that had astonished Willie Willders.\n\nPushing his way to the place where Mr Auberly and the others lay, the\nyouth fell on his knees.  \"My father!\" he exclaimed wildly.\n\n\"He's all right, lad,\" said Mr Braidwood, coming up at that moment, and\nlaying his hand kindly on the youth's shoulder; \"he's only choked with\nsmoke, and will be better in a minute.  Any more in the house?\" he added\nquickly.\n\nYoung Auberly leaped up with a shout.\n\n\"My sister! is she not saved?  Are _all_ here?\"\n\nHe waited not for a reply, but in another moment was on the fire-escape.\n\n\"After him, two of you,\" said Braidwood, turning to his men.\n\nTwo at once obeyed.  In fact, they had leaped forward almost before the\nbrief command was uttered.  One of these firemen was conspicuous for his\nheight and strength.  He was first up the ladder.  Close upon him\nfollowed Baxmore with a lantern.\n\nNothing but smoke had yet reached the room into which young Auberly\nentered, so that he instantly found himself in impenetrable darkness,\nand was almost choked as well as blinded.\n\n\"Have a care, Frank; the floor must be about gone by this time,\" said\nBaxmore, as he ran after his tall comrade.\n\nThe man whom he called Frank knew this.  He also knew that it was not\nlikely any one had been left in the room from which the master of the\nhouse had been rescued, and he thought it probable that his daughter\nwould occupy a room on the same floor with her father.  Acting on this\nsupposition, and taking for granted that the room they were about to\nenter was Mr Auberly's bedroom, the tall fireman dashed at once through\nthe smoke, and tumbled over the prostrate form of young Auberly.\n\n\"Look after him, Baxmore,\" he gasped, as he seized the lamp from his\ncomrade's hand, and darted across the room and out into the passage,\nwhere he went crash against a door and burst it open.  Here the smoke\nwas not so dense, so that he could breathe, though with difficulty.\n\nOne glance showed him where the bed was.  He felt it.  A female form was\nlying on it.  The light weight and the long hair which swept across his\nface as he raised it gently but swiftly on his shoulder, told him that\nit was that of a girl.\n\nAt that moment he heard a loud shout from the crowd, which was followed\nby a crash.  Dashing once more across the passage, he saw that a lurid\nflame was piercing the smoke in the other room.  The staircase he knew\nwas impassable; probably gone by that time; but he had not time to\nthink, so he drew the blanket over the girl's head and bounded towards\nthe window.  There was a feeling of softness under his feet, as if the\nfloor were made of pasteboard.  He felt it sinking beneath him.  Down it\nwent, just as he laid hold of the head of the fire-escape, from which he\nhung suspended in the midst of the smoke and sparks that rose from the\nfalling ruin.\n\nStrong though the young fireman was, he could not raise himself by one\narm, while the other was twined round Louisa Auberly.  At that moment,\nBaxmore, having carried young Auberly down in safety, again ascended and\nappeared at the window.  He seized Frank by the hair of the head.\n\n\"Let go my hair, and catch the girl!\" shouted Frank.\n\n\"All right,\" said Baxmore, seizing Loo and lifting her over the window\nsill.\n\nFrank being thus relieved, swung himself easily on the sill, and\ngrasping Loo once more, descended to the street, where he was met by Mr\nAuberly, who had recovered from his state of partial suffocation, and\nwho seized his child and hurried with her into a neighbouring house.\nThither he was followed by Mrs Rose and Matty, who had also recovered.\n\nDuring these episodes, the firemen had continued at their work with cool\nand undistracted attention.  And here the value of organisation was\nstrikingly and beautifully brought out; for, while the crowd swayed to\nand fro, now breathless with anxiety lest the efforts of the bold\nconductor of the fire-escape should fail; anon wild with excitement and\nloud in cheers when he succeeded, each fireman paid devoted and\nexclusive attention to his own prescribed piece of duty, as if nothing\nelse were going on around him, and did it with all his might--well\nknowing that every other piece of work was done, or point of danger\nguarded, by a comrade, while the eagle eyes of Mr Braidwood and his not\nless watchful foremen superintended all, observed and guided, as it\nwere, the field of battle.\n\nAnd truly, good generalship was required, for the foe was fierce and\nfurious.  The \"devouring element\" rushed onward like a torrent.  The\nhouse was large and filled with rich furniture, which was luxurious food\nfor the flames as they swept over the walls, twined round the\nbalustrades, swallowed the paintings, devoured the woodwork, and melted\nthe metal in their dread progress.  But the foe that met them was, on\nthis occasion, more than a match for the flames.  It was a hand-to-hand\nencounter.  The men followed them foot by foot, inch by inch--sometimes\nalmost singeing their beards or being well-nigh choked and blinded by\ndense volumes of smoke, but, if driven back, always returning to the\ncharge.  The heat at times beat on their helmets so fiercely that they\nwere forced to turn their faces aside and half-turn their backs on the\nfoe, but they _always_ kept their weapons--the \"branches\"--to the front,\nand continued to discharge upon him tons and tons of aqueous artillery.\n\n\"Get up to the windows now; use the escape,\" said Mr Braidwood; and as\nhe said this he passed through the doorway of the burning house.\n\nSome of the men rushed up the escape and let down a line, to which one\nof the branches was made fast.\n\n\"Avast pumpin', number two!\" shouted Baxmore from the midst of clouds of\nsmoke that were bursting out from the window.\n\nNumber two engine was stopped.  Its branch was pulled up and pointed\ninside _straight at the fire_; the signal given, \"Down with number two!\"\nand a hiss was followed by volumes of steam.\n\nThe work of extinction had at last begun in real earnest.  As long as\nthey could only stand in the street and throw water in through the\nwindows at haphazard, they might or might not hit the fire--and at all\nevents they could not attack its strong points; but now, Baxmore at one\nwindow, and one of the men of the first engine at another, played\npoint-blank into the flames, and, wherever the water hit, they were\nextinguished.  Presently they got inside and began to be able to see\nthrough the smoke; a blue glimmer became visible, the branch was\npointed, and it was gone.  By this time the second floor had partly\ngiven way, and fire was creeping down the rafters to the eaves of the\nhouse.  Baxmore observed this; and pointed the branch straight up.  The\nfire at that part was put out, and a heavy shower of water fell back on\nthe fireman, drenching him to the skin.\n\nThe attack had now become general.  The firemen swarmed in at the doors\nand windows the moment that it was possible for a human being to breathe\nthe smoke and live.  One of the engines attached two additional lengths\nof hose, dragged the branch through the first floor to the back of the\nhouse, got upon an outhouse, in at a back window, and attacked the foe\nin rear.  On the roof, Frank and Dale were plying their hatchets, their\ntall figures sharply defined against the wintry sky, and looking more\ngigantic than usual.  The enemy saved them the trouble of cutting\nthrough, however, for it suddenly burst upwards, and part of the roof\nfell in.  It would certainly have taken Frank prisoner had not Dale\ncaught him by the collar, and dragged him out of danger.  Instantly a\nbranch was pointed downwards, and the foe was beaten back; from above,\nbelow, before, and behind, it was now met with deluges of water, which\nfell on the shoulders of the men in the lower floor in a continuous hot\nshower, while they stood ankle-deep in hot water.\n\nIn ten minutes after this the fire was effectually subdued, the lower\nfloor having been saved, although its contents were severely damaged by\nwater.\n\nIt was only necessary now, that one of the engines should remain for a\ntime, to make good the victory.  The others rolled up their hose, and\nprepared to depart.  The King Street engine was the first to quit the\nfield of battle.  While the men were getting ready, Mr Auberly, muffled\nin a long cloak, stepped from the crowd and touched Frank, the tall\nfireman, on the shoulder.\n\n\"Sir,\" said he in a low voice, \"you saved my child.  I would show my\nsense of gratitude.  Will you accept of this purse?\"\n\nFrank shook his head and a smile played on his smoke-begrimed\ncountenance as he said:\n\n\"No, Mr Auberly.  I am obliged to you, but I cannot accept of it.  I do\nnot want it, and besides, the men of the brigade are not allowed to take\nmoney.\"\n\n\"But you will let me do something for you?\" urged Mr Auberly.  \"Is\nthere nothing that I can do?\"\n\n\"Nothing, sir,\" said Frank.  He paused for a moment, and then\nresumed--\"Well, there _is_ something that perhaps you could do, sir.  I\nhave a little brother out of employment; if you could get him a\nsituation, sir.\"\n\n\"I will,\" said Mr Auberly with emotion.  \"Send him to me on Thursday\nforenoon.  He will find me living next door to my--to my late home.  I\nshall stay with a friend there for some time.  Good-night.\"\n\n\"Men of King Street engine get up,\" cried Dale.  \"Stay--what is your\nname?\" said Mr Auberly turning round.\n\nBut Frank was gone.  He had leaped to his place on the engine and was\noff at a rattling pace through the now silent and deserted streets of\nthe sleeping city.\n\nAlthough they drove on at great speed there was no shouting now, for\nneither 'bus, cab, nor foot-passenger blocked up the way, and the men,\nbegrimed with smoke and charcoal, wet, and weary with two hours of\nalmost uninterrupted labour of a severe as well as dangerous character,\nsat or stood in their places in perfect silence.\n\nOn reaching the fire-station they leaped to the ground, and all went\nquickly and silently to their neighbouring homes and beds, except the\ntwo men on duty.  These, changing their coats and boots, lay down on the\ntrestles, and at once fell fast asleep--the engine and horses having\nbeen previously housed--and then Dale sat down to make an entry of the\nevent in his day-book.\n\nThe whole thing might have been only a vivid dream, so silent was the\nroom and so devoid of any evidence of recent excitement, while the\nreigning tranquillity was enhanced rather than decreased by the soft\nbreathing of the sleepers, the ticking of the clock, and the scratching\nof Dale's pen as he briefly recorded the facts of the fire that night in\nBeverly Square.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIVE.\n\nWILLIE WILLDERS IN DIFFICULTIES.\n\nDuring the progress of the fire, small Willie Willders was in a state of\nthe wildest, we might almost say hilarious, excitement; he regarded not\nthe loss of property; the fire never struck him in _that_ light.  His\nlittle body and big spirit rejoiced in the whole affair as a magnificent\ndisplay of fireworks and heroism.\n\nWhen the fire burst through the library windows he shouted; when Sam\nForest, the conductor of the fire-escape, saved Mr Auberly and the\nwomen, he hurrahed; when the tall fireman and Baxmore rescued Louisa\nAuberly he cheered and cheered again until his shrill voice rose high\nabove the shouting of the crowd.  When the floors gave way he screamed\nwith delight, and when the roof fell in he shrieked with ecstasy.\n\nSundry and persevering were the efforts he made to break through the\npolice by fair means and foul; but, in his energy, he over-reached\nhimself, for he made himself so conspicuous that the police paid special\nattention to him, and wherever he appeared he was snubbed and thrust\nback, so that his great desire to get close to the men while they were\nat work was frustrated.\n\nWillie had a brother who was a fireman, and he wished earnestly that he\nmight recognise him, if present; but he knew that, being attached to the\nsouthern district of the City, he was not likely to be there, and even\nif he were, the men were all so much alike in their uniform, that it was\nimpossible at a distance to distinguish one from another.  True it is\nthat his brother was uncommonly tall, and very strong; but as the London\nfiremen were all picked men, many of them were very tall, and all of\nthem were strong.\n\nNot until the last engine left the ground, did Willie Willders think it\nadvisable to tear himself away, and hasten to his home in Notting Hill,\nwhere he found his mother sitting up for him in a state of considerable\nanxiety.  She forebore to question him that night, however.\n\nWhen Willie appeared next morning--or rather, the same morning, for it\nwas nearly four o'clock when he went to bed--he found his mother sitting\nby the fire knitting a sock.\n\nMrs Willders was a widow, and was usually to be found seated by the\nfire, knitting a sock, or darning one, or mending some portion of male\nattire.\n\n\"So you were at a fire last night, Willie?\" said the widow.\n\n\"Yes, I was,\" replied the boy, going up to his mother, and giving her\nwhat he styled a \"roystering\" kiss, which she appeared to like, although\nshe was scarcely able to bear it, being thin and delicately formed, and\nsomewhat weak from bad health.\n\n\"No lives lost, I hope, Willie?\"\n\n\"No; there ain't often lives lost when Sam Forest, the fire-escape-man,\nis there.  You know Forest, mother, the man that we've heard so much of?\nAh, it _was_ sitch fun!  You've no notion!  It would have made you\nsplit your sides wi' laughin' if you'd seen Sam come out o' the smoke\ncarryin' the master o' the house on his shoulder in his shirt and\ndrawers, with only one sock on, an' his nightcap tied so tight under his\nchin that they had to cut it off--him in a swound, too, hangin' as limp\nas a dead eel on Sam's shoulder, with his head down one side, an' his\nlegs down the other.  Oh, it _was_ a lark!\"\n\nThe boy recalled \"the lark\" to his own mind so vividly, that he had to\nstop at this point, in order to give vent to an uproarious fit of\nlaughter.\n\n\"Was Frank there?\" inquired the widow, when the fit subsided.\n\n\"Not that I know of, mother; I looked hard for him, but didn't see him.\nThere was lots o' men big enough to be him; but I couldn't get near\nenough to see for the bobbies.  I wonder what them bobbies were made\nfor!\" continued Willie, with a look of indignation, as he seated himself\nat the table, and began to eat a hearty breakfast; \"the long lamp-posts!\nthat are always in the way when nobody wants 'em.  I do believe they was\ninvented for nothin' else than to aggravate small boys and snub their\ninquiring minds.\"\n\n\"Where was the fire, Willie?\"\n\n\"In Beverly Square.  I say, mother, if that there grocer don't send us\nbetter stuff than this here bacon in future, I'll--I'll have to give him\nup.\"\n\n\"I can't afford to get better, dear,\" said the widow meekly.\n\n\"I know that, mother; but _he_ could afford to _give_ better.  However,\nit's down now, so it don't much matter.\"\n\n\"Did you hear whose house was burned, Willie?\"\n\n\"A Mr Oberly, or somethin' like that.\"\n\n\"Auberly!\" exclaimed the widow, with a start.\n\n\"Well, p'raps it is Auberly; but whichever it is, he's got a pretty\nkettle o' fish to look after this mornin'.  You seem to have heard of\nhim before, mother?\"\n\n\"Yes, Willie, I--I know him a--at least I have met with him often.  You\nsee I was better off once, and used to mingle with--but I need not\ntrouble you with that.  On the strength of our former acquaintance, I\nthought I would write and ask him to get you a situation in an office,\nand I have got a letter from him, just before you came down to\nbreakfast, saying that he will do what he can, and bidding me send you\nto him between eleven and twelve to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Whew!\" whistled Willie, \"an' he burnt out o' house and home, without a\ncoat to his back or a shoe to his foot.  It strikes me I'll have to try\nto get _him_ a situation.\"\n\n\"He won't be found at the house, now, I dare say, my son, so we'll have\nto wait a little; but the burning of his house and furniture won't\naffect him much, for he's rich.\"\n\n\"Humph! p'raps not,\" said Willie; \"but the burnin' of his little girl\nmight have--\"\n\n\"You said that _no_ lives were lost,\" cried Mrs Willders, turning pale.\n\n\"No more there was, mother; but if it hadn't bin for one o' the firemen\nthat jumped in at a blazin' winder an' brought her out through fire an'\nsmoke, she'd have bin a cinder by this time, an' money wouldn't have\nbought the rich man another daughter, _I_ know.\"\n\n\"True, my son,\" observed Mrs Willders, resting her forehead on her\nhand; then, as if suddenly recollecting something, she looked up and\nsaid, \"Willie, I want you to go down to the City with these socks to\nFrank.  This is his birthday, and I sat late last night on purpose to\nget them finished.  His station is a long way _off_, I know, but you've\nnothing else to do, so--\"\n\n\"Nothin' else to do, mother!\" exclaimed Willie; with an offended look.\n\"Haven't I got to converse in a friendly way with all the\ncrossin'-sweepers an' shoeblacks an' stall-women as I go along, an'\nchaff the cabbies, an' look in at all the shop-windows, and insult the\nbobbies?  I _always_ insult the bobbies.  It does me good.  I hurt 'em,\nmentally, as much as I can, an' I'd hurt 'em bodily if I could.  But\nevery dog has his day.  When I grow up _won't_ I pitch into 'em!\"\n\nHe struck the table with his fist, and, shaking back his curly hair,\nlifted his blue eyes to his mother's face with a stern expression, which\ngradually relaxed into a smile.\n\n\"Ah, you needn't grin, mother, an' tell me that the \\`_policemen_' are a\nfine set of men, and quite as brave and useful in their way as the\nfiremen.  I know all you respectable sort of people think that; but _I_\ndon't.  They're my natural enemies, and I hate 'em.  Come, mother, give\nme the socks and let me be off.\"\n\nSoon the vigorous urchin was on his way to the City, whistling, as\nusual, with all his might.  As he passed the corner of the British\nMuseum a hand touched him on the shoulder, and its owner said:\n\n\"How much are ye paid a week, lad, for kicking up such a row?\"\n\nWillie looked round, and his eyes encountered the brass buckle of the\nwaist-belt of a tall, strapping fellow in a blue uniform.  Glancing\nupwards, he beheld the handsome countenance of his brother Frank looking\ndown at him with a quiet smile.  He wore no helmet, for except when\nattending a fire the firemen wear a sailor-like blue cloth cap.\n\n\"Hallo, Blazes! is that you?\" cried the boy.\n\n\"Just so, Willie; goin' down to Watling Street to attend drill.\"\n\nWillie (who had styled his brother \"Blazes\" ever since he joined the\nfire brigade) observed that he happened to be going in the same\ndirection to deliver a message from his mother to a relation, which he\nwould not speak about, however, just then, as he wished to tell him of a\nfire he had been at last night.\n\n\"A fire, lad; was it a big one?\"\n\n\"Ay, that it was; a case o' burnin'-out almost; _and there were lives\nsaved_,\" said the boy with a look of triumph; \"and that's more than you\ncan say you've seen, though you _are_ a fireman.\"\n\n\"Well, you know I have not been long in the brigade, Willie, and as the\nescapes often do their work before the engines come up, I've not had\nmuch chance yet of seeing lives saved.  How was it done?\"\n\nWith glowing eyes and flushed cheeks Willie at once launched out into a\nvivid description of the scene he had so recently witnessed, and dwelt\nparticularly on the brave deeds of Conductor Forest and the tall\nfireman.  Suddenly he looked up at his brother.\n\n\"Why, what are you chucklin' at, Blazes?\"\n\n\"Nothing, lad.  Was the fireman _very_ tall?\"\n\n\"That he certainly was--uncommon tall.\"\n\n\"Something like _me_?\" said Frank.\n\nA gleam of intelligence shot across the boy's face as he stopped and\ncaught his brother by the sleeve, saying earnestly:\n\n\"It wasn't _you_, Frank, _was_ it?\"\n\n\"It was, Willie, and right glad am I to have been in such good luck as\nto save Miss Auberly.\"\n\nWillie grasped his brother's hand and shook it heartily.\n\n\"You're a brick, Blazes,\" said he, \"and this is your birthday, an' I\nwish you luck an' long life, my boy.  You'll do me credit yet, if you go\non as you've begun.  Now, I'll go right away back an' tell mother.\nWon't she be fit to bu'st?\"\n\n\"But what about your message to the relation in the City?\" inquired\nFrank.\n\n\"That relation is yourself, and here's the message, in the shape of a\npair o' socks from mother; knitted with her own hands; and, by the way,\nthat reminds me--how came you to be at the fire last night?  It's a long\nway from your station.\"\n\n\"I've been changed recently,\" said Frank; \"poor Grove was badly hurt\nabout the loins at a fire in New Bond Street last week, and I have been\nsent to take his place, so I'm at the King Street station now.  But I\nhave something more to tell you before you go, lad, so walk with me a\nbit farther.\"\n\nWillie consented, and Frank related to him his conversation with Mr\nAuberly in reference to himself.\n\n\"I thought of asking leave and running out this afternoon to tell you,\nso it's as well we have met, as it will--Why, what are _you_ chuckling\nat, Willie?\"\n\nThis question was put in consequence of the boy's eyes twinkling and his\ncheeks reddening with suppressed merriment.\n\n\"Never mind, Blazes.  I haven't time to tell you just now.  I'll tell\nyou some other time.  So old Auberly wants to see me to-morrow\nforenoon?\"\n\n\"That's what he said to me,\" returned Frank.\n\n\"Very good; I'll go.  Adoo, Blazes--farewell.\"\n\nSo saying, Willie Willders turned round and went off at a run, chuckling\nviolently.  He attempted to whistle once or twice, but his mouth refused\nto retain the necessary formation, so he contented himself with\nchuckling instead.  And it is worthy of record that that small boy was\nso much engrossed with his own thoughts on this particular occasion that\nhe did not make one observation, bad, good, or indifferent, to any one\nduring his walk home.  He even received a question from a boy smaller\nthan himself as to whether \"his mother knew he was out,\" without making\nany reply, and passed innumerable policemen without even a thought of\nvengeance!\n\n\"Let me see,\" said he, muttering to himself as he paused beside the\nMarble Arch at Hyde Park, and leaned his head against the railings of\nthat structure; \"Mr Auberly has been an' ordered two boys to be sent to\nhim to-morrow forenoon--ha! he! sk!\"  (the chuckling got the better of\nhim here)--\"very good.  An' my mother has ordered one o' the boys to go,\nwhile a tall fireman has ordered the other.  Now, the question is, which\no' the two boys am I--the _one_ or the _t'other_--ha! sk! ho!  Well, of\ncourse, _both_ o' the boys will go; they can't help it, there's no\ngittin' over that; but, then, which of 'em will git the situation?\nThere's a scruncher for you, Mr Auberly.  You'll have to fill your\nhouse with tar an' turpentine an' set fire to it over again 'afore\nyou'll throw light on _that_ pint.  S'pose I should go in for _both_\nsituations!  It _might_ be managed.  The first boy could take a\nwell-paid situation as a clerk, an the second boy might go in for\nnight-watchman at a bank.\"  (Chuckling again interrupted the flow of\nthought.) \"P'raps the two situations might be got in the same place o'\nbusiness; that would be handy!  Oh! if one o' the boys could only be a\ngirl, _what_ a lark that would--sk! ha! ha!\"\n\nHe was interrupted at this point by a shoe-black, who remarked to his\ncompanion:\n\n\"I say, Bob, 'ere's a lark.  'Ere's a feller bin an got out o' Bedlam, a\nlarfin' at nothink fit to burst hisself!\"\n\nSo Willie resumed his walk with a chuckle that fully confirmed the\nmember of the black brigade in his opinion.\n\nHe went home chuckling and went to bed chuckling, without informing his\nmother of the cause of his mirth.  Chuckling he arose on the following\nmorning, and, chuckling still, went at noon to Beverly Square, where he\ndiscovered Mr Auberly standing, gaunt and forlorn, in the midst of the\nruins of his once elegant mansion.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX.\n\n\"WHEN ONE IS ANOTHER WHO IS WHICH?\"\n\n\"Well, boy, what do you want?  Have you anything to say to me?\"\n\nMr Auberly turned sharp round on Willie, whose gaze had gone beyond the\nlength of simple curiosity.  In fact, he was awe-struck at the sight of\nsuch a very tall and very dignified man standing so grimly in the midst\nof such dreadful devastation.\n\n\"Please, sir, I was sent to you, sir, by--\"\n\n\"Oh, you're the boy, the son of--that is to say, you were sent to me by\nyour mother,\" said Mr Auberly with a frown.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" replied Willie, hesitating, \"I--I--was sent by--by--\"\n\n\"Ah, I see,\" interrupted Mr Auberly with a smile that was meant to be\ngracious, \"you were sent by a fireman; you are not the--the--I mean\nyou're the _other_ boy.\"\n\nPoor Willie, being of a powerfully risible nature, found it hard to\ncontain himself on hearing his own words of the previous evening\nre-echoed thus unexpectedly.  His face became red, and he took refuge in\nblowing his nose, during which process--having observed the smile on Mr\nAuberly's face--he resolved to be \"the other boy.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" he said, looking up modestly, \"I was sent by a fireman; I\n_am_ the other boy.\"\n\nMr Auberly smiled again grimly, and said that the fireman was a brave\nfellow, and that he had saved his daughter's life, and that he was very\nglad to do anything that lay in his power for him, and that he\nunderstood that Willie was the fireman's brother; to which the boy\nreplied that he was.\n\n\"Well, then, come this way,\" continued Mr Auberly, leading Willie into\nthe library of the adjoining house, which his friend had put at his\ndisposal, and seating himself at a writing-table.  \"You want a situation\nof some sort--a clerkship, I suppose?\"\n\nWillie admitted that his ambition soared to that tremendous height.\n\n\"Let me see,\" muttered Mr Auberly, taking up a pen and beginning to\nwrite; \"yes, she will be able to help me.  What is your name, boy?\"\n\n\"Willie, sir.\"\n\n\"Just so, William; and your surname--your other name?\"\n\n\"Willders, sir.\"\n\nMr Auberly started, and looked Willie full in the eyes.  Willie,\nfeeling that he was playing a sort of double part without being able to\navoid it, grew red in the face.\n\n\"What did you say, boy?\"\n\n\"Willders,\" replied Willie stoutly.\n\n\"Then you're _not_ the other boy,\" said Mr Auberly, laying down his\npen, and regarding Willie with a frown.\n\n\"Please, sir,\" replied Willie, with a look of meekness which was mingled\nwith a feeling of desperation, for his desire to laugh was strong upon\nhim, \"please, sir, I don't rightly know _which_ boy I am.\"\n\nMr Auberly paused for a moment.\n\n\"Boy, you're a fool!\"\n\n\"Thank 'ee, sir,\" said Willie.\n\nThis reply went a long way in Mr Auberly's mind to prove the truth of\nhis assertion.\n\n\"Answer me, boy,\" said Mr Auberly with an impressive look and tone;\n\"were you sent here by a fireman?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Willie.\n\n\"What is his name?\"\n\n\"Same as mine, sir--Willders.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course,\" said Mr Auberly, a little confused at having\nput such an unnecessary question.  \"Does your _mother_ know you're\nhere?\"\n\nThis brought the slang phrase, \"Does your mother know you're out?\" so\nforcibly to the boy's mind, that he felt himself swell internally, and\nhad recourse again to his pocket-handkerchief as a safety-valve.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said he, on recovering his composure; \"arter I saw Blazes--\nFrank, I mean, that's my brother, sir--I goes right away home to bed.  I\nstops with my mother, sir, an' she saw me come off here this mornin',\nsir.  She knows I was comin' here.\"\n\n\"Of course; yes, yes, I see,\" muttered Mr Auberly, again taking up his\npen.  \"I see; yes, yes; same name--strange coincidence, though; but,\nafter all, there are many of that name in London.  I suppose the _other_\nboy will be here shortly.  Very odd, very odd indeed.\"\n\n\"Please, sir,\" observed Willie, in a gentle tone, \"you said _I_ was the\nother boy, sir.\"\n\nMr Auberly seemed a little annoyed at his muttered words being thus\nreplied to, yet he condescended to explain that there was another boy of\nthe same name whom he expected to see that morning.\n\n\"Oh, then there's _another_ other boy, sir?\" said Willie with a look of\ninterest.\n\n\"Hold your tongue!\" said Mr Auberly in a sharp voice; \"you're a fool,\nand you're much too fond of speaking.  I advise you to keep your tongue\nquieter if you wish to get on in life.\"\n\nWillie once more sought relief in his pocket-handkerchief, while his\npatron indited and sealed an epistle, which he addressed to \"Miss\nTippet, Number 6, Poorthing Lane, Beverly Square.\"\n\n\"Here, boy, take this to the lady to whom it is addressed--the lane is\nat the opposite corner of the square--and wait an answer.\"\n\n\"Am I to bring the answer back to you, sir?\" asked Willie with much\nhumility.\n\n\"No; the answer is for yourself,\" said Mr Auberly testily; \"and hark\n'ee, boy, you need not trouble me again.  That note will get you all you\ndesire.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Willie, making a bow, and preparing to retire;\n\"but please, sir, I don't very well know, that is to say--ahem!\"\n\n\"Well, boy?\" said the patron sternly.\n\n\"Excuse me, sir; I can't help it, you know; but please, sir, I wish to\nexplain about that other boy--no, that's me, but the _other_ other boy,\nyou know--\"\n\n\"Begone, boy!\" cried Mr Auberly in a voice so stern that Willie found\nhimself next moment in the street, along which he ran chuckling worse\nthan ever.\n\nA little reflection might have opened Mr Auberly's eyes to the truth in\nregard to Willie, but a poor relation was to him a disagreeable subject\nof contemplation, and he possessed the faculty, in an eminent degree, of\ndismissing it altogether from his mind.  Having care enough on his mind\nat that time, poor man, he deliberately cast the confusion of the two\nboys out of his thoughts, and gave himself up to matters more\ninteresting and personal.\n\nWe may add here that Mrs Willders was faithful to her promise, and\nnever more addressed her brother-in-law by word or letter.  When Willie\nafterwards told her and Frank of the absurdity of his interview, and of\nthe violent manner in which Mr Auberly had dismissed him when he was\ngoing to explain about the \"other\" boy, his mother thought it best to\nlet things rest as they stood, yet she often wondered in her own quiet\nway what Mr Auberly would think of her and of the non-appearance of the\n\"other\" boy; and she felt convinced that if he only put things together\nhe _must_ come to understand that Willie and Frank were her sons.  But\nMrs Willders did not know of the before-mentioned happy facility which\nher kinsman possessed of forgetting poor relations; so, after wondering\non for a time, she ceased to wonder or to think about it at all.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\n\nTHOUGHTS IN REGARD TO MEN.\n\nMiss Emelina Tippet was a maiden lady of pleasing countenance and\nexceedingly uncertain age.\n\nShe was a poor member of a poor branch of an aristocratic family, and\nfeeling an unconquerable desire to breathe, if not the pure\nunadulterated atmosphere of Beverly Square, at least as much of it as\nwas compatible with a very moderate income, she rented a small house in\na very dark and dismal lane leading out of that great centre of\nrefinement.\n\nIt is true that Beverly Square was not exactly the \"West End,\" but there\nare many degrees of West-endiness, so to speak, in the western\nneighbourhood of London, and this square was, in the opinion of Miss\nTippet, the West-endiest place she knew, because there dwelt in it, not\nonly a very genteel and uncommonly rich portion of the community, but\nseveral of her own aristocratic, though distant, relations, among whom\nwas Mr Auberly.\n\nThe precise distance of the relationship between them had never been\ndefined, and all records bearing on it having been lost in the mists of\nantiquity, it could not now be ascertained; but Miss Tippet laid claim\nto the relationship, and as she was an obliging, good-humoured, chatty,\nand musical lady, Mr Auberly admitted the claim.\n\nMiss Tippet's only weakness--for she was indeed a most estimable woman--\nwas a tendency to allow rank and position to weigh too much in her\nesteem.  She had also a sensitive abhorrence of everything \"low and\nvulgar,\" which would have been, of course, a very proper feeling had she\nnot fallen into the mistake of considering humble birth lowness, and\nwant of polish vulgarity--a mistake which is often (sometimes even\nwilfully) made by persons who consider themselves much wiser than Miss\nTippet, but who are not wise enough to see a distinct shade of true\nvulgarity in their own sentiments.\n\nThe dark, dismal lane, named Poorthing Lane, besides forming an asylum\nfor decayed and would-be aristocrats, and a vestibule, as it were, to\nBeverly Square, was a convenient retreat for sundry green-grocers and\npublic-house keepers and small trades-people, who supplied the\ndensely-peopled surrounding district, and even some of the inhabitants\nof Beverly Square itself, with the necessaries of life.  It was also a\nthoroughfare for the gay equipages of the square, which passed through\nit daily on their way to and from the adjoining stables, thereby\nendangering the lives of precocious babies who could crawl, but could\nnot walk away from home, as well as affording food for criticism and\nscandal, not to mention the leaving behind of a species of secondhand\nodour of gentility such as coachmen and footmen can give forth.\n\nMiss Tippet's means being small, she rented a proportionately small\nresidence, consisting of two floors, which were the upper portion of a\nhouse, whose ground floor was a toy-shop.  The owner of the toy-shop,\nDavid Boone, was Miss Tippet's landlord; but not the owner of the\ntenement.  He rented the whole, and sublet the upper portion.  Miss\nTippet's parlour windows commanded a near view of the lodging opposite,\ninto every corner and crevice of which she could have seen, had not the\nwindows been encrusted with impenetrable dirt.  Her own domestic\narrangements were concealed from view by small green venetian blinds,\nwhich rose from below, and met the large venetians which descended from\nabove.  The good lady's bedroom windows in the upper floor commanded a\nnear view--much too near--of a stack of chimneys, between which and\nanother stack, farther over, she had a glimpse of part of the gable end\nof a house, and the topmost bough of a tree in Beverly Square.  It was\nthis prospect into paradise, terrestrially speaking, that influenced\nMiss Tippet in the choice of her abode.\n\nWhen William Willders reached the small door of Number 6, Poorthing\nLane, and raised his hand to knock, the said door opened as if it had\nbeen trained to admit visitors of its own accord, and Miss Matty Merryon\nissued forth, followed by a bright blue-eyed girl of about twelve years\nof age.\n\n\"Well, boy, was ye comin' here?\" inquired Matty, as the lad stepped\naside to let them pass.\n\n\"Yes, I was.  Does Miss Tippet live here?\"\n\n\"She does, boy, what d'ye want with her?\"\n\n\"I want to see her, young 'ooman, so you'd better cut away up an' tell\nher a gen'lm'n requests a few words private conversation with her.\"\n\nThe little girl laughed at this speech, and Matty, addressing Willie as\na \"dirty spalpeen,\" said he had better go with her to a shop first, and\nshe'd then take him back and introduce him to Miss Tippet.\n\n\"You see I can't let ye in all be yer lone, cushla; for what would the\nneighbours say, you know!  I'm only goin' to the toy-shop, an' won't\nkape ye a minit, for Miss Emma don't take long to her bargains.\"\n\nWillie might probably have demurred to this delay; but on hearing that\nthe blue-eyed girl wanted to make purchases, he at once agreed to the\nproposal, and followed them into the toy-shop.\n\nDavid Boone, who stepped out of the back-shop to serve them, was, if we\nmay say so, very unlike his trade.  A grave, tall, long-legged,\nlong-nosed, raw-boned, melancholy-looking creature such as he, might\nhave been an undertaker, or a mute, or a sexton, or a policeman, or a\nhorse-guardsman, or even a lawyer; but it was the height of impropriety\nto have made him a toy-shopman, and whoever did it had no notion\nwhatever of the fitness of things.  One could not resist the idea that\nhis clumsy legs would certainly upset the slender wooden toys with which\nthe floor and counters were covered, and his fingers seemed made to\nbreak things.  The figure of Punch which hung from the ceiling appeared\ninclined to hit him as he passed to and fro, and the pretty little dolls\nwith the sweet pink faces, and very flaxen hair and cerulean eyes were\nevidently laughing at him.\n\nNevertheless, David Boone was a kind-hearted man, very fond of children,\nand extremely unlike, in some respects, what people imagined him at\nfirst sight to be.\n\n\"Well, Miss Ward, what can I supply you with to-day?\" said he blandly.\n\n\"Please, Mr Boone, I want a slate and a piece of slate-pencil.\"  Emma\nlooked up with a sweet smile at the tall shopman, who looked down upon\nher with grave benignity, as he produced the articles required.\n\n\"D'you kape turpentine?\" said Matty, as they were about to quit the\nshop.\n\nBoone started, and said almost testily, \"No, I _don't_.  Why do you\nask?\"\n\n\"Sure, there's no sin in askin',\" replied Matty in surprise at the man's\nchanged manner.\n\n\"Of course--of course not,\" rejoined Boone with a slight look of\nconfusion, as he made a sudden assault with his pocket-handkerchief on\nthe cat, which was sleeping innocently in the window; \"git out o' that,\nyou brute; you're always agoin' in the winder, capsizin' things.  There!\nyou've been an' sat on the face o' that 'ere wax doll till you've a'most\nmelted it.  Out o' that with you!  No, Miss Merryon,\" he added, turning\nto the girl with his wonted urbanity, \"I don't keep turpentine, and I\nwas only surprised you should ask for it in a toy-shop; but you'll get\nit of Mr White next door.  I don't believe there's anythink in the\nworld as he can't supply to his customers.\"\n\nDavid Boone bowed them out, and then re-entered the back-shop, shaking\nhis head slowly from side to side.\n\n\"I don't like it--I don't even like to think of it, Gorman,\" he said to\na big low-browed man who sat smoking his pipe beside the little\nfireplace, the fire in which was so small that its smoke scarcely\nequalled in volume that of the pipe he smoked: \"No, I _don't_ like it,\nand I _won't do it_.\"\n\n\"Well, well, you can please yourself,\" said Gorman, knocking the ashes\nout of his pipe, and placing it in his vest pocket as he rose and\nbuttoned his thick pea-jacket up to the chin; \"but I'll tell you what it\nis, if you _are_ a descendant of the hunter of the far west that you\nboast so much about, it's precious little of his pluck that you've got;\nan' so I tell 'ee to your face, David Boone.  All I've got to say is,\nthat you'd better be wise and take my advice, and think better of it.\"\n\nSo saying, Gorman went out, and slammed the door after him.\n\nMeanwhile, Miss Matty Merryon, having purchased a small phial of\nturpentine, returned to Number 6, and ushered Willie Willders into the\npresence of her mistress.\n\nMiss Emelina Tippet was neither tall nor stiff, nor angular nor bony; on\nthe contrary, she was little and plump, and not bad-looking.  And people\noften wondered why Miss Tippet _was_ Miss Tippet and was not Mrs\nSomebody-else.  Whatever the reason was, Miss Tippet never divulged it,\nso we won't speculate about it here.\n\n\"A note, boy, from Mr Auberly?\" exclaimed Miss Tippet, with a beaming\nsmile; \"give it me--thank you.\"\n\nShe opened it and read attentively, while Master Willie glanced round\nthe parlour and took mental notes.  Miss Emma Ward sat down on a stool\nin the window, ostensibly to \"do sums,\" but really to draw faces, all of\nwhich bore a strong caricatured resemblance to Willie, at whom she\nglanced slyly over the top of her slate.\n\nMatty remained standing at the door to hear what the note was about.\nShe did not pretend to busy herself about anything.  There was no\nsubterfuge in Matty.  She had been Miss Tippet's confidential servant\nbefore entering the service of Mr Auberly, and her extremely short stay\nin Beverly Square had not altered that condition.  She had come to feel\nthat she had a right to know all Miss Tippet's affairs, and so waited\nfor information.\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Miss Tippet, still reading, \"yes; \\`get him a situation\nin your brother's office,' (oh, certainly, I'll be sure to get that);\n\\`he seems smart, I might almost say impu--' Ahem!  Yes, well--.\"\n\n\"Boy,\" said Miss Tippet, turning suddenly to Willie, \"your name is\nWilliam Willders, I believe?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Well, William, Mr Auberly, my relative, asks me to get you into my\nbrother's--my brother's, what's 'is name--office.  Of course, I shall be\nhappy to try.  I am always extremely happy to do anything for--yes, I\nsuppose of course you can write, and, what d'ye call it--count--you can\ndo arithmetic?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" replied Willie.\n\n\"And you can spell--eh?  I hope you can _spell_, Edward, a--I mean\nThomas--is it, or William?\"\n\nMiss Tippet looked at Willie so earnestly and put this question in tones\nso solemn that he was much impressed, and felt as if all his earthly\nhopes hung on his reply, so he admitted that he could spell.\n\n\"Good,\" continued Miss Tippet.  \"You are, I suppose, in rather poor\ncircumstances.  Is your father poor?\"\n\n\"He's dead, ma'am; was drowned.\"\n\n\"Oh! shocking, that's very sad.  Was your mother drowned, too?\"\n\n\"No, ma'am, she's alive and well--at least she's well for _her_, but she\nan't over strong.  That's why I want to get work, that I may help her;\nand she wants me to be a clerk in a office, but I'd rather be a fireman.\nYou couldn't make me a fireman, could you, ma'am?\"\n\nAt this point Willie caught Miss Ward gazing intently at him over the\ntop of her slate, so he threw her into violent confusion by winking at\nher.\n\n\"No, boy, I can't make you a fireman.  Strange wish--why d'you want to\nbe one?\"\n\n\"'Cause it's such jolly fun,\" replied Willie; with real enthusiasm,\n\"reg'lar bangin' crashin' sort o' work--as good as fightin' any day!\nAn' my brother Frank's a fireman.  Such a one, too, you've no notion;\nsix fut four he is, an' as strong as--oh, why, ma'am, he could take you\nup in one hand, ma'am, an' twirl you round his head like an old hat!  He\nwas at the fire in Beverly Square last night.\"\n\nThis speech was delivered with such vehemence, contained so many\nobjectionable sentiments, and involved such a dreadful supposition in\nregard to the treatment of Miss Tippet's person, that the worthy lady\nwas shocked beyond all expression.  The concluding sentence, however,\ndiverted her thoughts.\n\n\"Ah! was he indeed at that sad fire, and did he help to put it out?\"\n\n\"Sure, an' he did more than that,\" exclaimed Matty, regarding the boy\nwith sudden interest.  \"If that was yer brother that saved Miss Loo he's\na ra'al man--\"\n\n\"Saved Loo!\" cried Miss Tippet; \"was it _your_ brother that saved Loo?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, it was.\"\n\n\"Bless him; he is a noble fellow, and I have great pleasure in taking\nyou by the hand for his sake.\"\n\nMiss Tippet suited the action to the word, and seized Willie's hand,\nwhich she squeezed warmly.  Matty Merryon, with tears in her eyes,\nembraced him, and said that she only wished she had the chance of\nembracing his brother, too.  Then they all said he must stay to lunch,\nas it was about lunchtime, and Miss Tippet added that he deserved to\nhave been born in a higher position in life--at least his brother did,\nwhich was the same thing, for he was a true what's-'is-name, who ought\nto be crowned with thingumyjigs.\n\nEmma, who had latterly been looking at Willie with deepening respect,\nimmediately crowned him with laurels on the slate, and then Matty rushed\naway for the lunch-tray--rejoicing in the fire, that had sent her back\nso soon to the old mistress whom she never wanted to leave; that had\nafforded scope for the display of such heroism, and had brought about\naltogether such an agreeable state of unwonted excitation.\n\nJust as the party were on the point of sitting down to luncheon, the\nstreet-door knocker was applied to the door with an extremely firm\ntouch.\n\n\"Miss Deemas!\" exclaimed Miss Tippet.  \"Oh!  I'm _so_ glad.  Rush,\nMatty.\"\n\nMatty rushed, and immediately there was a sound on the wooden passage as\nof a gentleman with heavy boots.  A moment later, and Matty ushered in a\nvery tall, broad-shouldered, strapping lady; if we may venture to use\nthat expression in reference to one of the fair sex.\n\nMiss Deemas was a sort of human eagle.  She had an eagle eye, an\naquiline nose, an eagle flounce, and an eagle heart.  Going up to Miss\nTippet, she put a hand on each of her shoulders, and stooping down,\npecked her, so to speak, on each cheek.\n\n\"How are you, my dear?\" said Miss Deemas, not by any means tenderly; but\nmuch in the tone in which one would expect to have one's money or one's\nlife demanded.\n\n\"Quite well, dear Julia, and _so_ glad to see you.  It is _so_ good of\nyou to take me by surprise this way; just at lunch-time, too.  Another\nplate and knife, Matty.  This is a little boy--a friend--not exactly a\nfriend, but a--a thingumy, you know.\"\n\n\"No, I _don't_ know, Emelina, what is the precise \\`thingumy' you refer\nto this time,\" said the uncompromising and matter-of-fact Miss Deemas.\n\n\"You're _so_ particular, dear Julia,\" replied Miss Tippet with a little\nsigh; \"a what's-'is-n-, a _protege_, you know.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Miss Deemas, regarding Willie with a severe frown, as if\nin her estimation all _proteges_ were necessarily villains.\n\n\"Yes, dear Julia, and, would you believe it, that this boy's\nbrother-in-law--\"\n\n\"Brother, ma'am,\" interrupted Willie.\n\n\"Yes, brother, actually saved my darling's life last night, at the--the\nthing in Beverly Square.\"\n\n\"What \\`darling's life,' and what \\`thing' in Beverly Square?\" demanded\nMiss Deemas.\n\n\"What! have you not heard of the fire last night in Beverly Square--my\nrelative, James Auberly--living there with his family--all burnt to\nashes--and my sweet Loo, too?  A what's-'is-name was brought, and a\nbrave fireman went up it, through fire and water and smoke.  Young\nAuberly went up before him and fell--heat and suffocation--and saved her\nin his arms, and his name is Frank, and he's this boy's brother-in-law!\"\n\nTo this brief summary, given with much excitement, Miss Deemas listened\nwith quiet composure, and then said with grim sarcasm, and very slowly:\n\n\"Let me see; there was a fire in Beverly Square last night, and James\nAuberly, living there with his family, were all burned to ashes.\"\n\nMiss Tippet here interrupted with, \"No, no;\" but her stern friend\nimposing silence, with an eagle look, continued:\n\n\"All burned to ashes, and also your sweet Loo.  A \\`what's-his-name'\nhaving been brought, a brave fireman goes up it, and apparently never\ncomes down again (burned to ashes also, I fancy); but young Auberly, who\nwent up before him, and fell--heat and suffocation being the result--\nsaved some one named \\`her' in his arms; his name being Frank (owing no\ndoubt to his having been re-baptised, for ever since I knew him he has\nbeen named Frederick), and he is this boy's brother-in-law!\"\n\nBy way of putting an extremely fine point on her sarcasm, Miss Deemas\nturned to Willie, with a very condescending air, and said:\n\n\"Pray, when did your sister marry Mr Frederick Auberly?\"\n\nWillie, with a face of meekness, that can only be likened to that of a\nyoung turtle-dove, replied:\n\n\"Please, ma'am, it isn't my sister as has married Mr Auberly; but it's\nmy brother, Frank Willders, as hopes to marry Miss Loo Auberly, on\naccount o' havin' saved her life, w'en she comes of age, ma'am.\"\n\nMiss Deemas stood aghast, or rather sat aghast, on receiving this reply,\nand scanned Willie's face with one of her most eagle glances; but that\nsmall piece of impudence wore an expression of weak good-nature, and\nwinked its eyes with the humility of a subdued pup, while Miss Tippet\nlooked half-horrified and half-amused; Matty grinned, and Emma squeaked\nthrough her nose.\n\n\"Boy,\" said Miss Deemas severely, \"your looks belie you.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" answered Willie, \"my mother always said I wasn't half so\nbad as I looked; and she's aware that I'm absent from home.\"\n\nAt this point Willie allowed a gleam of intelligence to shoot across his\nface, and he winked to Emma, who thereupon went into private convulsions\nin her handkerchief.\n\n\"Emelina,\" said Miss Deemas solemnly, \"let me warn you against that boy.\nHe is a bad specimen of a bad sex.  He is a precocious type of that\nbase, domineering, proud and perfidious creature that calls itself \\`lord\nof creation,' and which, in virtue of its superior physical power, takes\nup every position in life worth having,\" (\"except that of wife and\nmother,\" meekly suggested Miss Tippet), \"_worth having_\" (repeated the\neagle sternly, as if the position of wife and mother were _not_ worth\nhaving), \"worth having, and leaves nothing for poor weak-bodied, though\nnot weak-minded woman to do, except sew and teach brats.  Bah!  I hate\nmen, and they hate _me_, I know it, and I would not have it otherwise.\nI wish they had never been made.  I wish there had been none in the\nworld but women.  What a blessed world it would have been _then_!\"\n\nMiss Deemas hit the table with her hand, in a masculine manner, so\nforcibly, that the plates and glasses rattled, then she resumed, for she\nwas now on a favourite theme, and was delivering a lecture to a select\naudience.\n\n\"But, mark you, _I'm_ not going to be put down by men.  I mean to fight\n'em with their own weapons.  I mean to--\"\n\nShe paused suddenly at this point, and, descending from her platform,\nadvised Miss Tippet to dismiss the boy at once.\n\nPoor Miss Tippet prepared to do so.  She was completely under the power\nof Miss Deemas, whom, strange to say, she loved dearly.  She really\nbelieved that they agreed with each other on most points, although it\nwas quite evident that they were utterly opposed to each other in\neverything.  Wherein the bond lay no philosopher could discover.\nPossibly it lay in the fact that they were absolute extremes, and, in\nverification of the proverb, had met.\n\nBe this as it may, a note was quickly written to her brother, Thomas\nTippet, Esquire, which was delivered to Willie, with orders to take it\nthe following evening to London Bridge, in the neighbourhood of which\nMr Tippet dwelt and carried on his business.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\n\nA HIDDEN FIRE.\n\nIn the afternoon of the following day Willie set off to the City in\nquest of Mr Thomas Tippet.  Having to pass the King Street fire\nstation, he resolved to look in on his brother.\n\nThe folding-doors of the engine-house were wide open, and the engine\nitself, clean and business-like, with its brass-work polished bright,\nstood ready for instant action.  Two of the firemen were conversing at\nthe open door, while several others could be seen lounging about inside.\nIn one of the former Willie recognised the strong man who had collared\nhim on a well-remembered occasion.\n\n\"Please, sir,\" said Willie, going up to him, \"is Frank Willders inside?\"\n\n\"Why, youngster,\" said Dale, laying his hand on Willie's head, \"ain't\nyou the boy that pulled our bell for a lark the other night?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I am; but you let me off, you know, so I hope you won't bear\nme ill-will _now_.\"\n\n\"That depends on how you behave in future,\" said Dale with a laugh; \"but\nwhat d'you want with Frank Willders?\"\n\n\"I want to see him.  He's my brother.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed!  You'll find him inside.\"\n\nWillie entered the place with feelings of interest, for his respect for\nfiremen had increased greatly since he had witnessed their recent doings\nat the Beverly Square fire.\n\nHe found his brother writing at the little desk that stood in the\nwindow, while five or six of his comrades were chatting by the fire, and\na group in a corner were playing draughts, and spinning yarns of their\nold experiences.  All assisted in loading the air with tobacco-smoke.\n\nThe round cloth caps worn by the men gave them a much more sailor-like\nand much less fireman-like appearance than the helmets, which, with\ntheir respective hatchets, hung on the walls, rendering the apartment\nsomewhat like a cavalry guard-room.  This change in the head-piece, and\nthe removal of the hatchet, was the only alteration in their costume in\nwhat may be styled \"times of peace.\"  In other respects they were at all\ntimes accoutred, and in readiness to commence instant battle with the\nflames.\n\n\"Hallo, Blazes! how are ye?\" said Willie, touching his brother on the\nshoulder.\n\n\"That you, Willie?\" said Frank, without looking up from his work.\n\"Where away now?\"\n\n\"Come to tell ye there's a _fire_,\" said Willie, with a serious look.\n\n\"Eh? what d'ye mean?\" asked Frank, looking at his brother, as if he half\nbelieved he was in earnest.\n\n\"I mean what I say--a fire here,\" said Willie, solemnly striking his\nbreast with his clenched fist, \"here in Heart Street, Buzzum Square,\nragin' like fury, and all the ingins o' the fire brigade, includin' the\nfloat, couldn't put it out, no, nor even so much as squeanch it!\"\n\n\"Then it's of no use our turning out, I suppose?\" said Frank with a\nsmile, as he wiped his pen; \"what set it alight, lad?\"\n\n\"A wax doll with flaxen hair and blue eyes,\" answered Willie; \"them's\nthe things as has all along done for me.  When I was a boy I falled in\nlove with a noo wax doll every other day.  Not that I ever owned one\nmyself; I only took a squint at 'em in toy-shop winders, and they always\nhad flaxen hair and blue peepers.  Now that I've become a man, I've bin\nan' falled in love with a livin' wax doll, an' she's got flaxen hair an'\nblue eyes; moreover, she draws.\"\n\n\"Draws--boy! what does she draw--corks?\" inquires Frank.\n\n\"_No_!\" replied Willie, with a look of supreme contempt; \"nothin' so\nlow; she draws faces an' pictures like--like--a schoolmaster, and,\"\nadded Willie, with a sigh, \"she's bin an' drawed all the spirit out o'\nthis here buzzum.\"\n\n\"She must have left a good lot o' combustible matter behind, however, if\nthere's such a fire raging in it.  Who may this pretty fire-raiser be?\"\n\n\"Her name is Emma Ward, and she b'longs to a Miss Tippet, to whom she's\nrelated somehow, but I don't know where she got her, nor who's her\nparents.  This same Miss Tippet is some sort of a relation o' Mr\nAuberly, who sent me to her with a note, and she has sent me with\nanother note to her brother near London Bridge, who, I s'pose, will send\nme with another note to somebody else, so I'm on my way down to see him.\nI thought I'd look in to ask after you in passin', and cheer you on to\ndooty.\"\n\nA violent fit of somewhat noisy coughing from one of the men at the\nfireplace attracted Willie's attention at this point in the\nconversation.\n\n\"Wot a noisy feller you are, Corney,\" remarked one of the men.\n\n\"Faix,\" retorted Corney, \"it's noisy you'd be too av ye had the cowld in\nyer chist that I have.  Sure, if ye had bin out five times in wan night\nas I wos on Widsenday last, wid the branch to howld in a smoke as 'ud\nchoke Baxmore hisself (an' it's well known _he_ can stand a'most\nanything), not to spake o' the hose bu'stin' right betune me two feet.\"\n\n\"Come, come, Paddy,\" said Dale, interrupting; \"don't try to choke us,\nnow; you know very well that one of the fires was only a cut-away\naffair; two were chimneys, and one was a false alarm.\"\n\n\"True for ye!\" cried Corney, who had a tendency to become irascible in\nargument, or while defending himself; \"true for ye, Mister Dale, but\nthey _was_ alarms for all that, false or thrue, was they not now?\nAnyhow they alarmed me out o' me bed five times in a night as cowld as\nthe polar ragions, and the last time was a raale case o' two flats burnt\nout, an' four hours' work in iced wather.\"\n\nThere was a general laugh at this point, followed by several coughs and\nsneezes, for the men were all more or less afflicted with colds, owing\nto the severity of the weather and the frequency of the fires that had\noccurred at that time.\n\n\"There's some of us can sing chorus to Corney,\" observed one of the\ngroup.  \"I never saw such weather; and it seems to me that the worse the\nweather the more the fires, as if they got 'em up a purpose to kill us.\"\n\n\"Bill Moxey!\" cried another, \"you're _always_ givin' out some truism\nwith a face like Solomon.\"\n\n\"Well, Jack Williams,\" retorted Moxey, \"it's more than I can say of you,\nfor you never say anything worth listenin' to, and you couldn't look\nlike Solomon if you was to try ever so much.--You're too stoopid for\nthat.\"\n\n\"I say, lads,\" cried Frank Willders, \"what d'ye say to send along to the\ndoctor for another bottle o' cough mixture, same as the first?\"\n\nThis proposal was received with a general laugh.\n\n\"He'll not send us more o' _that_ tipple, you may depend,\" said\nWilliams.\n\n\"No, not av we wos dyin',\" said Corney, with a grin.\n\n\"What was it?\" asked Williams.\n\n\"Didn't you hear about it?\" inquired Moxey.  \"Oh, to be sure not; you\nwere in hospital after you got run over by the Baker Street engine.\nTell him about it, Corney.  It was you that asked the doctor, wasn't it,\nfor another bottle?\"\n\nCorney was about to speak, when a young fireman entered the room with\nhis helmet hanging on his arm.\n\n\"Is it go on?\" he inquired, looking round.\n\n\"No, it's go back, young Rags,\" replied Baxmore, as he refilled his\npipe; \"it was only a chimney, so you're not wanted.\"\n\n\"Can any o' you fellers lend me a bit o' baccy?\" asked Rags.  \"I've\nforgot to fetch mine.\"\n\n\"Here you are,\" said Dale, offering him a piece of twist.\n\n\"Han't ye got a bit o' hard baccy for the tooth?\" said Rags.\n\n\"Will that do?\" asked Frank Willders, cutting off a piece from a plug of\ncavendish.\n\n\"Thank'ee.  Good afternoon.\"\n\nYoung Rags put the quid in his cheek, and went away humming a tune.\n\nIn explanation of the above incident, it is necessary to tell the reader\nthat when a fire occurred in any part of London at the time of which we\nwrite, the fire-station nearest to it at once sent out its engines and\nmen, and telegraphed to the then head or centre station at Watling\nStreet.  London was divided into four districts, each district\ncontaining several fire stations, and being presided over by a foreman.\nFrom Watling Street the news was telegraphed to the foremen's stations,\nwhence it was transmitted to the stations of their respective districts,\nso that in a few minutes after the breaking out of a fire the fact was\nknown to the firemen _all over London_.\n\nAs we have said, the stations nearest to the scene of conflagration\nturned out engines and men; but the other stations furnished a man each.\nThus machinery was set in motion which moved, as it were, the whole\nmetropolis; and while the engines were going to the fire at full speed,\nsingle men were setting out from every point of the compass to walk to\nit, with their sailors' caps on their heads and their helmets on their\narms.\n\nAnd this took place in the case of every alarm of fire, because fire is\nan element that will not brook delay, and it does not do to wait to\nascertain whether it is worth while to turn out such a force of men for\nit or not.\n\nIn order, however, to prevent this unnecessary assembling of men when\nthe fire was found to be trifling, or when, as was sometimes the case,\nit was a false alarm, the fireman in charge of the engine that arrived\nfirst, at once sent a man back to the station with a \"stop,\" that is,\nwith an order to telegraph to the central station that the fire turns\nout to be only a chimney or a false alarm, and that all hands who have\nstarted from the distant stations may be \"stopped.\"  The \"stop\" was at\nonce telegraphed to the foremen, from whom it was passed (just as the\n\"call\" had been) to the outlying stations, and this second telegram\nmight arrive within quarter of an hour of the first.\n\nOf course the man from each station had set out before that time, and\nthe \"stop\" was too late for _him_, but it was his duty to call at the\nvarious fire stations he happened to pass on the way, where he soon\nfound out whether he was to \"go on\" or to \"go back.\"\n\nIf no telegram had been received, he went on to the fire; sometimes\nwalking four or five miles to it, \"at not less than four miles an hour.\"\nOn coming up to the scene of conflagration, he put on his helmet,\nthrust his cap into the breast of his coat, and reported himself to the\nchief of the fire brigade (who was usually on the spot), or to the\nforeman in command, and found, probably, that he had arrived just in\ntime to be of great service in the way of relieving the men who first\nattacked the flames.\n\nIf, on the other hand, he found that the \"stop\" had been telegraphed, he\nturned back before having gone much more than a mile from his own\nstation, and so went quietly home to bed.  In the days of which we write\nthe effective and beautiful system of telegraphy which now exists had\nnot been applied to the fire stations of London, and the system of\n\"stops\" and \"calls,\" although in operation, was carried out much less\npromptly and effectively by means of messengers.\n\nSome time before the entrance of Willie Willders into the King Street\nstation the engine had been turned out to a fire close at hand, which\nproved to be only a chimney on fire, and which was put out by means of a\nhand-pump and a bucket of water, while Moxey was sent back with the\n\"stop\" to the station.  The affair was over and almost forgotten, and\nthe men had resumed their pipes, as we have seen, when young Rags\nentered and was told to go back.\n\nApologising for this necessary digression, we return to Joe Corney.\n\n\"The fact was,\" said he, \"that we had had a fearful time of it that\nwinter--blowin' great guns an' snow nearly every night, an' what wi'\nheat at the fires an' cowld i' the streets, an' hot wather pourin' on us\nat wan minnit an' freezin' on us the nixt, a'most every man Jack of us\nwas coughin' an' sneezin', and watherin' so bad at our eyes an' noses,\nthat I do belave if we'd held 'em over the suction-pipes we might ha'\nfilled the ingins without throublin' the mains at all.  So the doctor he\nsaid, says he, \\`Lads, I'll send ye a bottle o' stuff as'll put ye\nright.'  An' sure enough down comes the bottle that night when we was\nsmokin' our pipes just afther roll-call.  It turned out to be the best\nmidcine ever was.  \\`Musha!' says I, \\`here's the top o' the marnin' to\nye, boys!'  Baxmore he smacks his lips when he tastes it, opens his\neyes, tosses off the glass, and holds it out for another.  \\`Howld on;\nfair play!' cried Jack Williams, so we all had a glass round.  It was\njust like lemonade or ginger-beer, it was.  So we sat down an' smoked\nour pipes over it, an' spun yarns an' sung songs; in fact we made a\njollification of it, an' when we got up to turn in there warn't a dhrop\nleft i' the bottle.\n\n\"\\`You'd better go to the doctor for another bottle,' says Moxey, as he\nwint out.\n\n\"\\`I will,' says I; \\`I'll go i' the marnin'.'\n\n\"Sure enough away I goes i' the marnin' to Doctor Offley.  \\`Doctor,'\nsays I, howldin' out the bottle, \\`we all think our colds are much the\nbetter o' this here midcine, an' I comed, av ye plaze, for another o'\nthe same.'\n\n\"Musha! but ye should ha' seen the rage he goes off into.  \\`Finished it\nall?' says he.  \\`Ivery dhrop, doctor,' says I, \\`at wan sittin'.'  At\nthat he stamped an' swore at me, an' ordered me away as if I'd bin a\npoor relation; an' says he, \\`I'll sind ye a bottle to-night as'll cure\nye!'  Sure so he did.  The second bottle would have poison'd a rat.  It\nlasted us all six months, an' I do belave ye'll find the most of it in\nthe cupboard at this minnit av ye look.\"\n\n\"Come, Willie,\" said Frank, while the men were laughing at the\nremembrance of this incident.  \"I'm going down your way and will give\nyou a convoy.  We can take a look in at the gymnastics as we pass, if\nyou choose.\"\n\n\"All right, Blazes, come along.\"  So saying they left the station, and\nset off at a brisk pace in the direction of the City.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINE.\n\nAUCTIONS AND GYMNASTICS.\n\nAs the brothers drew near to the busy region of the City which lies to\nthe north of London Bridge; Frank turned aside into one of the narrow\nstreets that diverge from the main thoroughfare.\n\n\"Where are ye goin'?\" inquired Willie.\n\n\"There was a fire here last night,\" said Frank; \"I want to have a look\nat the damage.\"\n\n\"A fire!\" exclaimed Willie.  \"Why, Blazes, it strikes me there's bin\nmore fires than usual last night in London.\"\n\n\"Only two, lad.\"\n\n\"_Only_ two!  How many would you have?\" asked Willie with a laugh.\n\n\"Don't you know,\" said Frank, \"that we have about four fires _every_\nnight?  Sometimes more, sometimes fewer.  Of course, we don't _all_ of\nus turn out to them; but some of the brigade turn out to that number, on\nan average, every night of the year.\"\n\n\"Are ye jokin', Frank?\"\n\n\"Indeed I am not.  I wish with all my heart I could say that I was\njoking.  It's a fact, boy.  You know I have not been long in the force,\nyet I've gone to as many as six fires in one night, and we _often_ go to\ntwo or three.  The one we are going to see the remains of just now was\ntoo far from us for our engine to turn out; but we got the call to send\na man on, and I was sent.  When I arrived and reported myself to Mr\nBraidwood, the two top floors were burnt out, and the fire was nearly\ngot under.  There were three engines, and the men were up on the\nwindow-sills of the second-floor with the branches, playin' on the last\nof the flames, while the men of the salvage-corps were getting the\nfurniture out of the first floor.  Conductor Brown was there with his\nescape, and had saved a whole family from the top floor, just before I\narrived.  He had been changed from his old station at the West End that\nvery day.  He's a wonderful fellow, that conductor!  Many a life he has\nsaved; but, indeed, the same may be said of most of the men in the\nforce, especially the old hands.  Here we are, lad.  This is the house.\"\n\nFrank stopped, as he spoke, in front of a ruined tenement, or rather, in\nfront of the gap which was now strewn with the charred and blackened\n_debris_ of what had once been a house.  The street in which it stood\nwas a narrow, mean one, inhabited by a poor, and, to judge from\nappearance, a dissipated class.  The remains of the house were guarded\nby policemen, while a gang of men were engaged in digging among the\nruins, which still smoked a little here and there.\n\n\"What are they diggin' for?\" asked Willie.\n\n\"I fear they are looking for dead bodies.  The house was let out to\nlodgers, and swarmed with people.  At first it was thought that all were\nsaved; but just before I was ordered home after the fire was got under,\nsome one said that an old man and his grandchild were missing.  I\nsuppose they're looking for them now.\"\n\nOn inquiring of a policeman, however, Frank learned that the remains of\nthe old man and his grandchild had already been found, and that they\nwere searching for the bodies of others who were missing.  A little\nbeyond the spot where the fire had occurred, a crowd was gathered round\na man who stood on a chair haranguing them, with apparently considerable\neffect, for ever and anon his observations were received with cries of\n\"Hear, hear,\" and laughter.  Going along the middle of the narrow\nstreet, in order to avoid the smell of the old-clothes'-shops and\npawnbrokers, as well as the risk of contact with their wares, Frank and\nWillie elbowed their way through the crowd to within a few yards of the\nspeaker.\n\n\"What is he?\" inquired Frank of a rather dissipated elderly woman.\n\n\"He's a clown or a hacrobat, or somethink of that sort, in one of the\ntheatres or music-'alls.  He's bin burnt out o' his 'ome last night,\nan's a-sellin' off all he's been able to save, by hauction.\"\n\n\"Come; now, ladies an' gents,\" cried the clown, taking up a rather\nseedy-looking great-coat, which he held aloft with one hand, and pointed\nto it with the other, \"Who's agoin' to bid for this 'ere garment--a\nhextra superfine, double-drilled, kershimere great-coat, fresh from the\nlooms o' Tuskany--at least it was fresh from 'em ten years ago (that was\nwhen my grandfather was made Lord Mayor of London), an' its bin renewing\nits youth (the coat, not the Lord Mayor) ever since.  It's more glossy,\nI do assure you, ladies and gents, than w'en it fust comed from the\nlooms, by reason of the pile havin' worn off; and you'll obsarve that\nthe glossiness is most beautiful and brightest about the elbows an' the\nseams o' the back.  Who bids for this 'ere venerable garment?  Six bob?\nCome now, don't all bid at once.  Who said six bob?\"\n\nNo reply being made to this, except a laugh, the clown (who, by the way,\nwore a similarly glossy great-coat, with a hat to match) protested that\nhis ears must have deceived him, or his imagination had been whispering\nhopeful things--which was not unlikely, for his imagination was a very\npowerful one--when he noticed Frank's tall figure among the crowd.\n\n\"Come now, fireman, this is the wery harticle you wants.  You comed out\nto buy it, I know, an' 'ere it is, by a strange coincidence, ready-made\nto hand.  What d'ye bid?  Six bob?  Or say five.  I know you've got a\nwife an' a large family o' young firemen to keep, so I'll let it go\ncheap.  P'raps it's too small for you; but that's easy put right.\nYou've only got to slit it up behind to the neck, which is a' infallible\ncure for a tight fit, an' you can let down the cuffs, which is double,\nan' if it's short you can cut off the collar, an' sew it on to the\nskirts.  It's water-proof, too, and fire-proof, patent asbestos.  W'en\nit's dirty you've got nothin' to do but walk into the fire, an' it'll\ncome out noo.  W'en it's thoroughly wet on the houtside, turn it hinside\nhout, an' there you are, to all appearance as dry as bone.  What! you\nwon't have it at no price?  Well, now, I'll tempt you.  I'll make it\n_two_ bob.\"\n\n\"Say one,\" cried a baker, who had been listening to this, with a broad\ngrin on his floury countenance.\n\n\"Ladies and gents,\" cried the clown, drawing himself up with dignity;\n\"there's an individual in this crowd--I beg parden, this assemblage--as\nasks me to say \\`one.'  I _do_ say \\`one,' an' I say it with melancholy\nfeelin's as to the liberality of my species.  One bob!  A feller-man as\nhas bin burnt hout of 'is 'ome an' needs ready money to keep 'im from\nstarvation, offers his best great-coat--a hextra superfine,\ndouble-drilled (or milled, I forget w'ich) kershimere, from the looms o'\nTuskany--for one bob!\"\n\n\"One-an'-six,\" muttered an old-clothes-man, with a black cotton sack on\nhis shoulder.\n\n\"One-an'-six,\" echoed the clown with animation; \"one-an'-six bid;\none-an'-six.  Who said one-an'-seven?  Was it the gent with the red\nnose?--No, one-an'-six; goin' at the ridiculously low figure of\none-an'-six--gone! as the old 'ooman said w'en her cat died o'\napple-plexy.  Here you are; hand over the money.  I can't knock it down\nto you, 'cause I haven't a hauctioneer's 'ammer.  Besides, it's agin' my\nprinciples.  I've never knocked nothin' down, not even a skittle, since\nI joined the Peace Society.\n\n\"Now, ladies an' gents, the next thing I've got to hoffer is a\nharm-chair.  Hand up the harmchair, Jim.\"\n\nA very antique piece of furniture was handed up by a little boy, whom\nWillie recognised as the little boy who had once conversed with him in\nfront of the chocolate-shop in Holborn Hill.\n\n\"Thank you, my son,\" said the clown, taking the chair with one hand and\npatting the boy's head with the other; \"this, ladies and gents,\" he\nadded in a parenthetical tone, \"is my son; _he's_ bin burnt hout of\n'ouse an' 'ome, too!  Now, then, who bids for the old harm-chair? the\nwery identical harm-chair that the song was written about.  In the\nembrace o' this 'ere chair has sat for generations past the family o'\nthe Cattleys--that's _my_ name, ladies an gents, at your service.  Here\nsat my great-great-grandfather, who was used to say that his\ngreat-grandfather sat in it too.  Here sat his son, and his son's son--\nthe Lord Mayor as was--and his son, my father, ladies and gents, who\ndied in it besides, and whose son now hoffers it to the 'ighest bidder.\nYou'll observe its antiquity, ladies an' gents.  That's its beauty.\nIt's what I may call, in the language of the haristocracy, a harticle of\n_virtoo_, w'ich means that it's a harticle as is surrounded by virtuous\nmemories in connection with the defunct.  Now then, say five bob for the\nhold harm-chair!\"\n\nWhile the clown was endeavouring to get the chair disposed of, Willie\npushed his way to the side of Jim Cattley.\n\n\"I say, youngster, would you like a cup o' chocolate?\" began Willie by\nway of recalling to the boy their former meeting.\n\nJim, whose face wore a sad and dispirited look, turned angrily and said,\n\"Come, I don't want none o' your sauce!\"\n\n\"It ain't sauce I'm talkin' of, it's chocolate,\" retorted Willie.  \"But\ncome, Jim, I don't want to bother ye.  I'm sorry to see you an yer dad\nin sitch a fix.  Have you lost much?\"\n\n\"It's not what we've lost that troubles us,\" said Jim, softened by\nWillie's sympathetic tone more than by his words; \"but sister Ziza is\ntook bad, an' she's a fairy at Drury Lane, an' takin' her down the\nfire-escape has well-nigh killed her, an' we've got sitch a cold damp\ncellar of a place to put her in, that I don't think she'll get better at\nall; anyhow, she'll lose her engagement, for she can't make two speeches\nan' go up in a silver cloud among blue fire with the 'flooenzer, an 'er\n'air all but singed off 'er 'ead.\"\n\nJim almost whimpered at this point, and Willie, quitting his side\nabruptly, went back to Frank (who was still standing an amused auditor\nof the clown), and demanded a shilling.\n\n\"What for, lad?\"\n\n\"Never you mind, Blazes; but give me the bob, an' I'll pay you back\nbefore the week's out.\"\n\nFrank gave him a shilling, with which he at once returned to Jim, and\nthrusting it into his hand, said:\n\n\"There, Jim, your dad's hard up just now.  Go you an' get physic with\nthat for the fairy.  Them 'floo-enzers is ticklish things to play with.\nWhere d'ye stop?\"\n\n\"Well, you _are_ a queer 'un; thank'ee all the same,\" said Jim,\npocketing the shilling.  \"We've got a sort o' cellar just two doors east\no' the burnt 'ouse.  Why?\"\n\n\"'Cause I'll come an' see you, Jim.  I'd like to see a live fairy in\nplain clo'se, with her wings off--\"\n\nThe rest of the sentence was cut short by the clown, who, having\ndisposed of the old arm-chair to a chimney-sweep, ordered Jim to \"'and\nup another harticle.\"  At the same moment Frank touched Willie on the\nshoulder, and said, \"Let's go, lad; I'll be late, I fear, for the\ngymnastics.\"\n\nAt the period of which we write, the then Chief of the London Fire\nBrigade, Mr Braidwood, had introduced a system of gymnastic training\namong the firemen, which he had found from experience to be a most\nuseful exercise to fit the men for the arduous work they had to perform.\nBefore going to London to take command of and reorganise the brigade\nwhich then went by the name of the London Fire-Engine Establishment, and\nwas in a very unsatisfactory condition, Mr Braidwood had, for a long\nperiod, been chief of the Edinburgh Fire Brigade, which he had brought\nto a state of great efficiency.  Taking the requirements and conditions\nof the service in Edinburgh into consideration, he had come to the\nconclusion that the best men for the work in that city were masons,\nhouse-carpenters, slaters, and suchlike; but these men, when at their\nordinary employments, being accustomed to bring only certain muscles\ninto full play, were found to have a degree of stiffness in their\ngeneral movements which prevented them from performing their duty as\nfiremen with that ease and celerity which are so desirable.  To obviate\nthis evil he instituted the gymnastic exercises, which, by bringing all\nthe muscles of the body into action, and by increasing the development\nof the frame generally, rendered the men lithe and supple, and in every\nway more fitted for the performance of duties in which their lives\nfrequently depended on their promptitude and vigour.\n\nIn addition to these advantages, it was found that those exercises gave\nthe men confidence when placed in certain situations of danger.  \"For\nexample,\" writes Mr Braidwood, \"a fireman untrained in gymnastics, on\nthe third or fourth floor of a burning house, with the branch in his\nhands, who is uncertain as to his means of escape, in the event of his\nreturn by the stair being cut off, will be too much concerned about his\nown safety to render much service, and will certainly not be half so\nefficient as the experienced gymnast, who, with a hatchet and eighty\nfeet of rope at his waist, and a window near him, feels himself in\ncomparative security, knowing that he has the means and the power of\nlowering himself easily and safely into the street\"--a knowledge which\nnot only gives him confidence, but enables him to give his undistracted\nattention to the exigencies of the fire.\n\nIt was to attend this gymnastic class that Frank now turned aside, and\nproposed to bid Willie goodbye; but Willie begged to be taken into the\nroom.  Frank complied, and the boy soon found himself in an apartment\nfitted up with all the appliances of a gymnasium, where a number of\npowerful young men were leaping, vaulting, climbing, and in other ways\nimproving their physical powers.  Frank joined them, and for a long time\nWillie stood in rapt and envious contemplation of the busy scene.\n\nAt first he could not avoid feeling that there seemed a good deal more\nof play than business in their doings; but his admiration of the scene\ndeepened when he remembered the bold acts of the firemen at Beverly\nSquare, and recognised some of the faces of the men who had been on duty\nthere, and reflected that these very men, _who seemed thus to be playing\nthemselves_, would on that very night, in all probability, be called\nupon to exert these powers sternly and seriously, yet coolly, in the\nmidst of scenes of terror and confusion, and in the face of imminent\npersonal danger.\n\nBrooding over these things, Willie, having at length torn himself away,\nhastened on his pilgrimage to London Bridge.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TEN.\n\nDIFFICULTIES AND DISSIPATIONS.\n\nIn a very small office, situate in a very large warehouse, in that great\nstorehouse of the world's wealth, Tooley Street, sat a clerk named\nEdward Hooper.\n\nAmong his familiar friends Edward was better known by the name of Ned.\n\nHe was seated on the top of a tall three-legged stool, which, to judge\nfrom the uneasy and restless motions of its occupant, must have been a\npeculiarly uncomfortable seat indeed.\n\nThere was a clock on the wall just opposite to Ned's desk, which that\nyoung gentleman was in the habit of consulting frequently--very\nfrequently--and comparing with his watch, as if he doubted its veracity.\nThis was very unreasonable, for he always found that the two timepieces\ntold the truth; at least, that they agreed with each other.\nNevertheless, in his own private heart, Ned Hooper thought that clock--\nand sometimes called it--\"the slowest piece of ancient furniture he had\never seen.\"\n\nDuring one of Ned's comparisons of the two timepieces the door opened,\nand Mr Auberly entered, with a dark cloud, figuratively speaking, on\nhis brow.\n\nAt the same moment the door of an inner office opened, and Mr Auberly's\nhead clerk, who had seen his employer's approach through the dusty\nwindow, issued forth and bowed respectfully, with a touch of condolence\nin his air, as he referred with much regret to the fire at Beverly\nSquare, and hoped that Miss Auberly was not much the worse of her late\nalarm.\n\n\"Well, she is not the better for it,\" said Mr Auberly; \"but I hope she\nwill be quite well soon.  Indeed, the doctor assures me of this, if care\nis taken of her.  I wish that was the only thing on my mind just now;\nbut I am perplexed about another matter, Mr Quill.  Are you alone?\"\n\n\"Quite alone, sir,\" said Quill, throwing open the door of the inner\noffice.\n\n\"I want to consult with you about Frederick,\" said Mr Auberly as he\nentered.\n\nThe door shut out the remainder of the consultation at this point, so\nEdward Hooper consulted the clock again and sighed.\n\nIf sighs could have delivered Hooper from his sorrows, there is no doubt\nthat the accumulated millions of which he was delivered in that office,\nduring the last five years, would have filled him with a species of\nsemi-celestial bliss.\n\nAt last, the hands of the clock reached the hour, _the_ hour that was\nwont to evoke Ned's last sigh and set him free; but it was an\naggravating clock.  Nothing would persuade it to hurry.  It would not,\nfor all the untold wealth contained in the great stores of Tooley\nStreet, have abated the very last second of the last minute of the hour.\nOn the contrary, it went through that second quite as slowly as all the\nothers.  Ned fancied it went much slower at that one on purpose; and\nthen, with a sneaking parade of its intention to begin to strike, it\ngave a prolonged hiss, and did its duty, and nothing _but_ its duty; by\nstriking the hour at a pace so slow, that it recalled forcibly to Ned\nHooper's imaginative mind, \"the minute-gun at sea.\"\n\nThere was a preliminary warning given by that clock some time before the\npremonitory hiss.  Between this harbinger of coming events, and the\njoyful sound which was felt to be \"an age,\" Ned was wont to wipe his pen\nand arrange his papers.  When the hiss began, he invariably closed his\nwarehouse book and laid it in the desk, and had the desk locked before\nthe first stroke of the hour.  While the \"minute-gun at sea\" was going\non, he changed his office-coat for a surtout, not perfectly new, and a\nwhite hat with a black band, the rim of which was not perfectly\nstraight.  So exact and methodical was Ned in these operations, that his\nhand usually fell on the door-latch as the last gun was fired by the\naggravating clock.  On occasions of unusual celerity he even managed to\ndrown the last shot in the bang of the door, and went off with a\nsensation of triumph.\n\nOn the present occasion, however, Ned Hooper deemed it politic to be so\nbusy, that he could not attend to the warnings of the timepiece.  He\neven sat on his stool a full quarter of an hour beyond the time of\ndeparture.  At length, Mr Auberly issued forth.\n\n\"Mr Quill,\" said he, \"my mind is made up, so it is useless to urge such\nconsiderations on me.  Good-night.\"\n\nMr Quill, whose countenance was sad, looked as though he would\nwillingly have urged the considerations referred to over again, and\nbacked them up with a few more; but Mr Auberly's tone was peremptory,\nso he only opened the door, and bowed the great man out.\n\n\"You can go, Hooper,\" said Mr Quill, retiring slowly to the inner\noffice, \"I will lock up.  Send the porter here.\"\n\nThis was a quite unnecessary permission.  Quill, being a good-natured,\neasy-going man, never found fault with Ned Hooper, and Ned being a\npresumptuous young fellow, though good-humoured enough, never waited for\nMr Quill's permission to go.  He was already in the act of putting on\nthe white hat; and, two seconds afterwards, was in the street wending\nhis way homeward.\n\nThere was a tavern named the \"Angel\" at the corner of one of the streets\noff Tooley Street, which Edward Hooper had to pass every evening on his\nway home.  Ned, we grieve to say, was fond of his beer; he always found\nit difficult to pass a tavern.  Yet, curiously enough, he never found\nany difficulty in passing this tavern; probably because he always went\nin and slaked his thirst _before_ passing it.\n\n\"Good evening, Mr Hooper,\" said the landlord, who was busy behind his\ncounter serving a motley and disreputable crew.\n\nHooper nodded in reply, and said good evening to Mrs Butler, who\nattended to the customers at another part of the counter.\n\n\"Good evenin', sir.  W'at'll you 'ave to-night, sir?\"\n\n\"Pot o' the same, Mrs B,\" replied Ned.\n\nThis was the invariable question and reply, for Ned was a man of\nregularity and method in everything that affected his personal comforts.\nHad he brought one-tenth of this regularity and method to bear on his\nbusiness conduct, he would have been a better and a happier man.\n\nThe foaming pot was handed, and Ned conversed with Mrs Butler while he\nenjoyed it, and commenced his evening, which usually ended in\nsemi-intoxication.\n\nMeanwhile, Edward Hooper's \"chum\" and fellow-lodger sat in their mutual\nchamber awaiting him.\n\nJohn Barret did not drink, but he smoked; and, while waiting for his\ncompanion, he solaced himself with a pipe.  He was a fine manly fellow,\nvery different from Ned; who, although strong of limb and manly enough,\nwas slovenly in gait and dress, and bore unmistakable marks of\ndissipation about him.\n\n\"Very odd; he's later than usual,\" muttered Barret, as he glanced out at\nthe window, and then at the tea-table, which, with the tea-service, and,\nindeed everything in the room, proved that the young men were by no\nmeans wealthy.\n\n\"He'll be taking an extra pot at the \\`Angel,'\" muttered John Barret,\nproceeding to re-light his pipe, while he shook his head gravely; \"but\nhe'll be here soon.\"\n\nA foot on the stair caused Barret to believe that he was a true prophet;\nbut the rapidity and firmness of the step quickly disabused him of that\nidea.\n\nThe door was flung open with a crash, and a hearty youth with glowing\neyes strode in.\n\n\"Fred Auberly!\" exclaimed Barret in surprise.\n\n\"Won't you welcome me?\" demanded Fred.\n\n\"Welcome you?  Of course I will, most heartily, old boy!\" cried Barret,\nseizing his friend's hand and wringing it; \"but if you burst in on a\nfellow unexpectedly in this fashion, and with such wild looks, why--\"\n\n\"Well, well, don't explain, man; I hate explanations.  I have come here\nfor sympathy,\" said Fred Auberly, shutting the door and sitting down by\nthe fire.\n\n\"Sympathy, Fred?\"\n\n\"Ay, sympathy.  When a man is in distress he naturally craves for\nsympathy, and he turns, also naturally, to those who can and will give\nit--not to _everybody_, John Barret--only to those who can feel _with_\nhim as well as _for_ him.  I am in distress, John, and ever since you\nand I fought our first and last battle at Eton, I have found you a true\nsympathiser.  So now, is your heart ready to receive the flood of my\nsorrows?\"\n\nYoung Auberly said the latter part of this in a half-jesting tone, but\nhe was evidently in earnest, so his friend replied by squeezing his hand\nwarmly, and saying, \"Let's hear about it, Fred,\" while he re-lighted his\npipe.\n\n\"You have but a poor lodging here, John,\" said Auberly, looking round\nthe room.\n\nBarret turned on his friend a quick look of surprise, and then said,\nwith a smile:\n\n\"Well, I admit that it is not _quite_ equal to a certain mansion in\nBeverly Square that I wot of, but it's good enough for a poor clerk in\nan insurance office.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" continued Auberly; \"it is _not_ equal to that mansion,\nwhose upper floors are at this moment a _chevaux-de-frise_ of charcoal\nbeams and rafters depicted on a dark sky, and whose lower floors are a\nfantastic compound of burned bricks and lime, broken boards, and\nblackened furniture.\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say there's been a fire?\" exclaimed Barret.\n\n\"And _you_ don't mean to tell me, do you, that a clerk in a fire\ninsurance office does not know it?\"\n\n\"I have been ill for two days,\" returned Barret, \"and have not seen the\npapers; but I'm very sorry to hear of it; indeed I am.  The house is\ninsured, of course?\"\n\n\"I believe it is,\" replied Fred carelessly; \"but _that_ is not what\ntroubles me.\"\n\n\"No?\" exclaimed his friend.\n\n\"No,\" replied the other.  \"If the house had not been insured my father\nhas wealth enough in those abominably unpicturesque stores in Tooley\nStreet to rebuild the whole of Beverly Square if it were burnt down.\nThe fire costs me not a thought, although, by the way, it nearly cost me\nmy life, in a vain attempt I made to rescue my poor dear sister Loo--\"\n\n\"_Vain_ attempt!\" exclaimed Barret, with a look of concern.\n\n\"Ay, vain, as far as I was concerned; but a noble fireman--a fellow that\nwould make a splendid model for Hercules in the Life Academy--sprang to\nthe rescue after me and saved her.  God bless him!  Dear Loo has got a\nsevere shake, but the doctors say that we have only to take good care of\nher, and she will do well.  But to return to my woes.  Listen, John, and\nyou shall hear.\"\n\nFred Auberly paused, as though meditating how he should commence.\n\n\"You know,\" said he, \"that I am my father's only son, and Loo his only\ndaughter.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, my father has disinherited me and left the whole of his fortune\nto Loo.  As far as dear Loo is concerned I am glad; for myself I am sad,\nfor it is awkward, to say the least of it, to have been brought up with\nunlimited command of pocket-money, and expectations of considerable\nwealth, and suddenly to find myself all but penniless, without a\nprofession and without expectations, at the age of twenty-two.\"\n\nHe paused and looked at his friend, who sat in mute amazement.\n\n\"Failing Loo,\" continued Fred calmly, \"my father's fortune goes to some\ndistant relative.\"\n\n\"But why? wherefore?\" exclaimed Barret.\n\n\"You shall hear,\" continued Auberly.  \"You are aware that ever since I\nwas able to burn the end of a stick and draw faces on the nursery-door,\nI have had a wild, insatiable passion for drawing; and ever since the\nmemorable day on which I was whipped by my father, and kissed,\ntearfully, by my beloved mother, for caricaturing our cook on the\ndining-room window with a diamond-ring, I have had an earnest,\nunextinguishable desire to become a--a painter, an artist, a dauber, a\ndirtier of canvas.  D'ye understand?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" said Barret.\n\n\"Well, my father has long been resolved, it seems, to make me a man of\nbusiness, for which I have no turn whatever.  You are aware that for\nmany years I have dutifully slaved and toiled at these heavy books in\nour office--which have proved so heavy that they have nearly squeezed\nthe soul out of me--and instead of coming to like them better (as I was\nled to believe I should), I have only come to hate them more.  During\nall this time, too, I have been studying painting late and early, and\nalthough I have not gone through the regular academical course, I have\nstudied much in the best of all schools, that of Nature.  I have urged\nupon my father repeatedly and respectfully, that it is possible for me\nto uphold the credit of the family as a painter; that, as the business\ncan be carried on by subordinates, there is no necessity for me to be at\nthe head of it; and that, as he has made an ample fortune already, the\nhalf of which he had told me was to be mine, I would be quite satisfied\nwith my share, and did not want any more.  But my father would never\nlisten to my arguments.  The last time we got on the subject he called\nme a mean-spirited fellow, and said he was sorry I had ever been born;\nwhereupon I expressed regret that he had not been blessed with a more\ncongenial and satisfactory son, and tried to point out that it was\nimpossible to change my nature.  Then I urged all the old arguments over\nagain, and wound up by saying that even if I were to become possessor of\nthe whole of his business to-morrow, I would sell it off, take to\npainting as a profession, and become the patron of aspiring young\npainters from that date forward!\n\n\"To my surprise and consternation, this last remark put him in such a\ntowering rage, that he vowed he would disinherit me, if I did not then\nand there throw my palette and brushes into the fire.  Of course, I\ndeclined to do such an act, whereupon he dismissed me from his presence\nfor ever.  This occurred on the morning of the day of the fire.  I\nthought he might perhaps relent after such an evidence of the mutability\nof human affairs.  I even ventured to remind him that Tooley Street was\nnot made of asbestos, and that an _occasional_ fire occurred there!  But\nthis made him worse than ever; so I went the length of saying that I\nwould, at all events, in deference to his wishes, continue to go to the\noffice at least for some time to come.  But, alas!  I had roused him to\nsuch a pitch that he refused to hear of it, unless I should \\`_throw my\npalette and brushes into the fire_!'  Flesh and blood, you know, could\nnot do that, so I left him, and walked off twenty miles into the country\nto relieve my feelings.  There I fell in with _such_ a splendid \\`bit;' a\nsluice, with a stump of a tree, and a winding bit of water with\noverhanging willows, and a peep of country beyond!  I sat down and\nsketched, and forgot my woes, and _rejoiced_ in the fresh air and\ndelightful sounds of birds, and cows, and sheep, and _hated_ to think of\nTooley Street.  Then I slept in a country inn, walked back to London\nnext day, and, _voila_! here I am!\"\n\n\"Don't you think, Fred, that time will soften your father?\"\n\n\"No, I don't think it.  On the contrary, I know it won't.  He is a good\nman; but he has an iron will, which I never saw subdued.\"\n\n\"Then, my dear Fred, I advise you to consider the propriety of throwing\nyour palette and brushes into--\"\n\n\"My dear John, I did not come here for your advice.  I came for your\nsympathy.\"\n\n\"And you have it, Fred,\" cried Barret earnestly.  \"But have you really\nsuch an unconquerable love for painting?\"\n\n\"Have I really!\" echoed Fred.  \"Do you think I would have come to such a\npass as this for a trifle?  Why, man, you have no idea how my soul longs\nfor the life of a painter, for the free fresh air of the country, for\nthe poetry of the woods, the water, and the sky, for the music of bird\nand beast and running brook.  You know the true proverb, \\`Man made the\ntown; but God made the country!'\"\n\n\"What,\" asked Barret, \"would become of the town, if all men thought as\nyou do?\"\n\n\"Oh!  John Barret, has town life so marred your once fine intellect,\nthat you put such a question in earnest?  Suppose I answer it by\nanother: What would become of the country if all men thought and acted\nas you do?\"\n\nBarret smiled and smoked.\n\n\"And what,\" continued Auberly, \"would become of the fine arts if all men\ndelighted in dirt, dust, dullness, and desks?  Depend upon it, John,\nthat our tastes and tendencies are not the result of accident; they were\ngiven to us for a purpose.  I hold it as an axiom that when a man or a\nboy has a strong and decided bias or partiality for any particular work\nthat he knows _something_ about, he has really a certain amount of\ncapacity for that work beyond the average of men, and is led thereto by\na higher power than that of man.  Do not misunderstand me.  I do not say\nthat, when a boy expresses a longing desire to enter the navy or the\narmy, he has necessarily an aptitude for these professions.  Far from\nit.  He has only a romantic notion of something about which,\nexperimentally, he knows nothing; but, when man or boy has put his hand\nto any style of work, and _thereafter_ loves it and longs after it, I\nhold that that is the work for which he was destined, and for which he\nis best suited.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are right,\" said Barret, smoking harder than ever.  \"At all\nevents, I heartily sympathise with you, and--\"\n\nAt this point the conversation was interrupted by a loud burst of\nwhistling, as the street-door opened and the strains of \"Rule Britannia\"\nfilled the entire building.  The music was interrupted by the sudden\nopening of another door, and a rough growl from a male voice.\n\n\"Don't get waxy, old feller,\" said the performer in a youthful voice, \"I\nain't a-goin' to charge you nothink for it.  I always do my music\ngratis; havin' a bee-nevolient turn o' mind.\"\n\nThe door was slammed violently, and \"Rule Britannia\" immediately burst\nforth with renewed and pointed emphasis.\n\nPresently it ceased, and a knock came to Barret's door.\n\n\"Well, what d'ye want, you noisy scamp?\" said Barret, flinging the door\nopen, and revealing the small figure of Willie Willders.\n\n\"Please, sir,\" said Willie, consulting the back of a note; \"are you\nMister T-Tom--Tupper, Esquire?\"\n\n\"No, I'm not.\"\n\n\"Ain't there sitch a name in the house?\"\n\n\"No, not that I know of.\"\n\nWillie's face looked blank.\n\n\"Well, I was told he lived here,\" he muttered, again consulting the\nnote.\n\n\"Here, let me look,\" said Barret, taking the note from the boy.  \"This\nis Tippet, not Tupper.  He lives in the top floor.  By the way,\nAuberly,\" said Barret, glancing over his shoulder, \"Isn't Tom Tippet a\nsort of connection of yours?\"\n\n\"Yes; a distant one,\" said Fred carelessly, \"too distant to make it\nworth while our becoming acquainted.  He's rich and eccentric, I'm told.\nAssuredly, he must be the latter if he lives in such a hole as this.\nWhat are you staring at, boy?\"\n\nThis question was put to Willie.\n\n\"Please, sir, are _you_ the Mr Auberly who was a'most skumfished with\nsmoke at the Beverly Square fire t'other day, in tryin' to git hold o'\nyer sister?\"\n\nFred could not but smile as he admitted the fact.\n\n\"Please, sir, I hope yer sister ain't the wuss of it, sir.\"\n\n\"Not much, I hope; thank you for inquiring; but how come you to know\nabout the fire, and to be interested in my sister?\"\n\n\"'Cause I was there, sir; an' it was _my brother_, sir, Frank Willders,\nas saved your sister.\"\n\n\"Was it, indeed!\" exclaimed Fred, becoming suddenly interested.  \"Come,\nlet me hear more about your brother.\"\n\nWillie, nothing loth, related every fact he was acquainted with in\nregard to Frank's career, and his own family history, in the course of\nwhich he revealed the object of his visit to Mr Tippet.  When he had\nfinished, Frederick Auberly shook hands with him and said:\n\n\"Now, Willie, go and deliver your note.  If the application is\nsuccessful, well; but if it fails, or you don't like your work, just\ncall upon me, and I'll see what can be done for you.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, and thankee,\" said Willie; \"where did you say I was to call,\nsir?\"\n\n\"Call at--eh--ah--yes, my boy, call _here_, and let my friend Mr Barret\nknow you want to see me.  He will let me know, and you shall hear from\nme.  Just at present--well, never mind, go and deliver your note now.\nYour brother is a noble fellow.  Good-night.  And you're a fine little\nfellow yourself,\" he added, after Willie closed the door.\n\nThe fine little fellow gave vent to such a gush of \"Rule Britannia\" at\nthe moment, that the two friends turned with a smile to each other.\n\nJust then a man's voice was heard at the foot of the stair, grumbling\nangrily.  At the same moment young Auberly rose to leave.\n\n\"Good-night, Barret.  I'll write to you soon as to my whereabout and\nwhat about.  Perhaps see you ere long.\"\n\n\"Good-night.  God prosper you, Fred.  Good-night.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the grumbler came stumbling along the passage.\n\n\"Good-night again, Fred,\" said Barret, almost pushing his friend out.\n\"I have a particular reason for not wishing you to see the fr-, the man\nwho is coming in.\"\n\n\"All right, old fellow,\" said Fred as he passed out, and drew up against\nthe wall to allow a drunken man to stumble heavily into the room.\n\nNext moment he was in the street hastening he knew not whither; but\nfollowing the old and well-known route to Beverly Square.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\n\nWONDERFUL PLANS.\n\nWhen Willie Willders knocked at Tom Tippet's door, at the top of the\nhouse, a rich jovial bass voice cried, \"Come in.\"  So Willie went in,\nand stood before a stout old gentleman, whose voluminous whiskers,\nmeeting below his chin, made ample amends for the total absence of hair\nfrom the top of his head.\n\nMr Tippet stood, without coat or vest, and with his braces tied round\nhis waist, at a carpenter's bench, holding a saw in his right hand, and\na piece of wood in his left.\n\n\"Well, my lad, what's _your_ business?\" he inquired in the voice of a\nstentor, and with the beaming smile of an elderly cherub.\n\n\"Please, sir, a note--from a lady.\"\n\n\"I wish your message had been verbal, boy.  It's so difficult to read\nladies' hands; they're so abominably angular, and--where _are_ my specs?\nI've a mind to have 'em screw-nailed to my nose.  Ah! here they are.\"\n\nHe found them under a jack-plane and a mass of shavings; put them on and\nread the note, while Willie took the opportunity of observing that Mr\nTippet's room was a drawing-room, parlour, dining-room, workshop, and\nold curiosity-shop, all in one.  A half-open door revealed the fact that\nan inner chamber contained Mr Tippet's bed, and an indescribable mass\nof machinery and models in every stage of progression, and covered with\ndust, more or less thick in exact proportion to their respective ages.\nA dog and cat lay side by side on the hearth asleep, and a small fire\nburned in a grate, on the sides of which stood a variety of crucibles\nand such-like articles and a glue-pot; also a tea-pot and kettle.\n\n\"You want a situation in my office as a clerk?\" inquired Mr Tippet,\ntearing up his sister's letter, and throwing it into the fire.\n\n\"If you please, sir,\" said Willie.\n\n\"Ha! are you good at writing and ciphering?\"\n\n\"Middlin', sir.\"\n\n\"Hum!  D'you know where my office is, and what it is?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"What would you say now,\" asked Mr Tippet, seating himself on his\nbench, or rather on the top of a number of gimblets and chisels and\nfiles and pincers that lay on it; \"what would you say now to sitting\nfrom morning till night in a dusty ware-room, where the light is so\nfeeble that it can scarcely penetrate the dirt that encrusts the\nwindows, writing in books that are so greasy that the ink can hardly be\ngot to mark the paper?  How would you like that, William Willders--eh?\"\n\n\"I don't know, sir,\" replied Willie, with a somewhat depressed look.\n\n\"Of course you don't, yet that is the sort of place you'd have to work\nin, boy, if I engaged you, for that is a correct description of my\nwarehouse.  I'm a sleeping partner in the firm.  D'ye know what that is,\nboy?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, it's a partner that does no work; but I'm wide-awake for all\nthat, an' have a pretty good notion of what is going on there.  Now,\nlad, if I were to take you in, what would you say to 5 pounds a year?\"\n\n\"It don't sound much, sir,\" said Willie bluntly, \"but if you take me in\nwith the understandin' that I'm to work my way up'ards, I don't mind\nabout the pay at first.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Mr Tippet, with a nod of approval.  \"What d'ye think of my\nworkshop?\" he added, looking round with a cherubic smile.\n\n\"It's a funny place,\" responded Willie, with a grin.\n\n\"A funny place--eh?  Well, I daresay it is, lad, in your eyes; but let\nme tell you, it is a place of deep interest, and, I may add without\nvanity, importance.  There are inventions here, all in a state bordering\nmore or less upon completion, which will, when brought into operation,\nmodify the state of society very materially in many of its most\nprominent phases.  Here, for instance, is a self-acting\ngalvano-hydraulic engine, which will entirely supersede the use of\nsteam, and, by preventing the consumption of coal now going on, will\navert, or at least postpone, the decline of the British Empire.  Able\nmen have calculated that, in the course of a couple of hundred years or\nso, our coal-beds will be exhausted.  I have gone over their\ncalculations and detected several flaws in them, which, when corrected,\nshow a very different result--namely, that in seventeen or eighteen\nyears from this time there will not be an ounce of coal in the kingdom!\"\n\nMr Tippet paused to observe the effect of this statement.  Willie\nhaving never heard of such things before, and having a thoughtful and\nspeculative as well as waggish turn of mind, listened with open eyes and\nmouth and earnest attention, so Mr Tippet went on:\n\n\"The frightful consequences of such a state of things you may conceive,\nor rather they are utterly inconceivable.  Owing to the foundations of\nthe earth having been cut away, it is more than probable that the\npresent coal districts of the United Kingdom will collapse, the ocean\nwill rush in, and several of our largest counties will become salt-water\nlakes.  Besides this, coal being the grand source of our national\nwealth, its sudden failure will entail national bankruptcy.  The\nbarbarians of Europe, taking advantage of our condition, will pour down\nupon us, and the last spark of true civilisation in our miserable world\nwill be extinguished--the last refuge for the hunted foot of persecuted\nFreedom will be finally swept from the face of the earth!\"\n\nHere Mr Tippet brought the saw down on the bench with such violence,\nthat the dog and cat started incontinently to their legs, and Willie\nhimself was somewhat shaken.\n\n\"Now,\" continued Mr Tippet, utterly regardless of the sensation he had\ncreated, and wiping the perspiration from his shining head with a\nhandful of shavings; \"now, William Willders, all this may be, _shall_\nbe, prevented by the adoption of the galvano-hydraulic engine, and the\nconsequent restriction of the application of coal to the legitimate\npurposes of warming our dwellings and cooking our victuals.  I mean to\nbring this matter before the Home Secretary whenever I have completed my\ninvention, which, however, is not _quite_ perfected.\n\n\"Then, again,\" continued Mr Tippet, becoming more and more enthusiastic\nas he observed the deep impression his explanations were making on\nWillie, who stood glaring at him in speechless amazement, \"here you have\nmy improved sausage-machine for converting all animal substances into\nexcellent sausages.  I hold that every animal substance is more or less\ngood for food, and that it is a sad waste to throw away bones and hair,\netcetera, etcetera, merely because these substances are unpalatable or\ndifficult to chew.  Now, my machine gets over this difficulty.  You cut\nan animal up just as it is killed, and put it into the machine--hair,\nskin, bones, blood, and all--and set it in motion by turning on the\ngalvano-hydraulic fluid.  Delicious sausages are the result in about\ntwenty minutes.\n\n\"You see my dog there--Chips I call him, because he dwells in the midst\nof chips and shavings; he sleeps upon chips, and if he does not exactly\neat chips, he lives upon scraps which have a strong resemblance to them.\nThe cat has no name.  I am partial to the time-honoured name of \\`Puss.'\nBesides, a cat is not worthy of a name.  Physically speaking, it is\nonly a bundle of living fur--a mere mass of soft animated nature, as\nGoldsmith would express it.  Intellectually it is nothing--a sort of\nexistent nonentity, a moral void on which a name would be utterly thrown\naway.  Well, I could take these two animals, Chips and Puss, put them in\nhere (alive, too, for there is a killing apparatus in the instrument\nwhich will effectually do away with the cruel process of slaughtering,\nand with its accompanying nuisances of slaughter-houses and butchers)--\nput them in here, I say, and in twenty minutes they would be ground up\ninto sausages.\n\n\"I know that enemies to progress, ignorant persons and the like, will\nscoff at this, and say it is similar to the American machine, into one\nend of which you put a tree, and it comes out at the other end in the\nshape of ready-made furniture.  But such scoffs will cease, while my\ninvention will live.  I am not bigoted, William.  There may be good\nobjections to my inventions, and great difficulties connected with them,\nbut the objections I will answer, and the difficulties I will overcome.\n\n\"This instrument,\" continued Mr Tippet, pointing to a huge beam, which\nleant against the end of the small apartment, \"is only a speculative\neffort of mine.  It is meant to raise enormous weights, such as houses.\nI have long felt it to be most desirable that people should be able to\nraise their houses from their foundations by the strength of a few men,\nand convey them to other localities, either temporarily or permanently.\nI have not succeeded yet, but I see my way to success; and, after all,\nthe idea is not new.  You can see it partially carried out by an\nenterprising company in this city, whose enormous vans will remove the\nwhole furniture of a drawing-room, almost as it stands, without packing.\nMy chief difficulty is with the fulcrum; but that is a difficulty that\nmet the philosopher of old.  You have heard of Archimedes, William--the\nman who said he could make a lever big enough to move the world, if he\ncould only get a fulcrum to rest it on.  But Archimedes was weak in that\npoint.  He ought to have known that, even if he did get such a fulcrum,\nhe would still have required another world as long as his lever, to\nenable him to walk out to the end of it.  No, by the way, he might have\nwalked _on_ the lever itself!  That did not occur to me before.  He\nmight even have ridden along it.  Come, that's a new idea.  Let me see.\"\n\nIn order the better to \"see,\" Mr Tippet dropt the piece of wood from\nhis left hand, and pressed his fingers into both eyes, so as to shut out\nall earthly objects, and enable him to take an undistracted survey of\nthe chambers of his mind.  Returning suddenly from the investigation, he\nexclaimed:\n\n\"Yes, William, I don't quite see my way to it; but I can perceive dimly\nthe possibility of Archimedes having so formed his lever, that a line of\nrails might have been run along the upper side of it, from the fulcrum\nto the other end.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" exclaimed Willie, who, having become excited, was entering\neagerly into his patron's speculations, and venting an occasional remark\nin the height of his enthusiasm.\n\n\"Such a thing _might_ be done,\" continued Mr Tippet emphatically; \"a\nsmall carriage--on the galvano-hydraulic principle, of course--might run\nto and fro--\"\n\n\"With passengers,\" suggested Willie.\n\n\"Well--with passengers,\" assented Mr Tippet, smiling.  \"Of course, the\nlever would be very large--extremely large.  Yes, there _might_ be\npassengers.\"\n\n\"An' stations along the line?\" said Willie.\n\nMr Tippet knitted his brows.\n\n\"Ye-yes--why not?\" he said slowly.  \"Of course, the lever would be very\nlong, extremely long, and it might be necessary to stop the carriages on\nthe way out.  There might be breadth sufficient on the lever to plant\nsmall side stations.\"\n\n\"An' twenty minutes allowed for refreshments,\" suggested Willie.\n\n\"Why, as to that,\" said Mr Tippet, \"if we stop at all, there could be\nno reasonable objection to refreshments, although it is probable we\nmight find it difficult to get anyone sufficiently enterprising to\nundertake the supply of such a line; for, you know, if the lever were to\nslip at the fulcrum and fall--\"\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Willie, \"_wouldn't_ there be a smash; neither!\"\n\n\"The danger of people falling off, too,\" continued Mr Tippet, \"might be\nprevented by railings run along the extreme edges of the lever.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" interrupted Willie, whose vivid imagination, unused to such\nexcitement, had taken the bit in its teeth and run away with him; \"an'\nspikes put on 'em to keep the little boys from swinging on 'em, an'\ngettin' into mischief.  Oh! what jolly fun it would be.  Only think!\nwe'd advertise cheap excursion trains along the Arkimeedis Line, Mondays\nan' Toosdays.  Fares, two hundred pounds, fust class.  No seconds or\nparleys allowed for love or money.  Starts from the Fuddlecrum Sta--\"\n\n\"Fulcrum,\" said Mr Tippet, correcting.\n\n\"Fulcrum Station,\" resumed Willie, \"at 2:30 a.m. of the mornin'\nprecisely.  Stops at the Quarter, Half-way, an' Three-quarter Stations,\nallowin' twenty minutes, more or less, for grub--weather permittin'.\"\n\n\"Your observations are quaint,\" said Mr Tippet, with a smile; \"but\nthere is a great deal of truth in them.  No doubt, the connection of\nsuch ideas, especially as put by you, sounds a little ludicrous; but\nwhen we come to analyse them, we see their possibility, for, _if_ a\nlever of the size indicated by the ancient philosopher were erected (and\ntheoretically, the thing _is_ possible), then the subordinate\narrangements as to a line of railway and stations, etcetera, would be\nmere matters of detail.  It might be advertised, too, that the balance\nof the lever would be so regulated, that, on the arrival of the train at\nthe terminus, the world would rise (a fact which might be seen by the\nexcursionists, by the aid of enormous telescopes, much better than by\nthe people at home), and that, on the return of the train, the world\nwould again sink to its ancient level.\n\n\"There would be considerable risk, no doubt,\" continued Mr Tippet\nmeditatively, \"of foolish young men and boys getting over the rails in\nsport or bravado, and falling off into the depths of illimitable\nprofundity, but--\"\n\n\"We could have bobbies stationed along the line,\" interrupted Willie,\n\"an' tickets put up warnin' the passengers not to give 'em money on no\naccount wotsomedever, on pain o' bein' charged double fare for the\nfirst offence, an' pitched over the rails into illimidibble\npro-what's-'is-name for the second.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what it is, William,\" said Mr Tippet suddenly, getting\noff the bench and seizing the boy's hand, \"your talents would be wasted\nin my office.  You'll come and assist me here in the workshop.  I'm\ngreatly in want of an intelligent lad who can use his hands; but, by the\nway, can you use your hands?  Here, cut this piece of wood smooth, with\nthat knife.\"\n\nHe handed Willie a piece of cross-grained wood and a blunt knife.\n\nWillie looked at both, smiled, and shook his head.\n\n\"It would take a cleverer feller than me to do it; but I'll try.\"\n\nWillie did try; after a quarter of an hour spent in vain attempts, he\nthrew down the wood and knife exclaiming, \"It's impossible.\"\n\nMr Tippet, who had been smiling cherubically, and nodding approval,\nsaid:\n\n\"I knew it was impossible, my lad, when I gave it to you, and I now know\nthat you are both neat-handed and persevering; so, if you choose, I'll\nengage you on the spot to come on trial for a week.  After that we will\nsettle the remuneration.  Meanwhile, shake hands again, and allow me to\nexpress to you my appreciation of the noble character of your brother,\nwho, I understand from my sister's letter, saved a young relative of\nmine from the midst of imminent danger.  Good-night, William, and come\nto me on Monday next, at nine o'clock in the morning.\"\n\nWillie was somewhat perplexed at this prompt dismissal (for Mr Tippet\nhad opened the door), especially after such a long and free-and-easy\nconversation, and he felt that, however much license Mr Tippet might\npermit, he was a man of stern will, who could not be resisted with\nimpunity; so, although he was burning to know the object and nature of\ninnumerable strange pieces of mechanism in the workshop, he felt\nconstrained to make a polite bow and depart.\n\nOn his way downstairs, he heard the voices of men as if in angry\ndisputation; and on reaching the next floor, found Mr Barret standing\nat the open door of his room, endeavouring to hold Ned Hooper, who was\nstruggling violently.\n\n\"I tell you,\" said the latter, in a drunken voice, \"that I w-will go\nout!\"\n\n\"Come, Ned, not to-night; you can go to-morrow\" said Barret soothingly,\nyet maintaining his hold of his friend.\n\n\"W-why not? ain't night the best time to--to--be jolly?--eh!  L-me go, I\nshay.\"\n\nHe made a fierce struggle at this point; and Barret, ceasing to\nexpostulate, seized him with a grasp that he could not resist, and\ndragged him forcibly, yet without unnecessary violence, into the room.\n\nNext instant the door was shut with a bang and locked; so Willie\nWillders descended to the street, and turned his face homewards,\nmoralising as he went on the evils of drink.\n\nIt was a long way to Notting Hill; but it was not long enough to enable\nWillie to regain his wonted nonchalance.  He had seen and heard too much\nthat night to permit of his equilibrium being restored.  He pursed his\nmouth several times into the form of a round O, and began \"Rule\nBritannia\"; but the sounds invariably died at the part where the\n\"charter of the land\" is brought forward.  He tried \"The Bay of Biscay,\nO!\" with no better success, never being able to get farther than\n\"lightning's vivid powers,\" before his mind was up in the clouds, or in\nMr Tippet's garret, or out on the Archimedes-Lever Railway.\n\nThus wandering in dreams he reached home, talked wildly to his anxious\nmother, and went to bed in a state of partial insanity.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\n\nA LITTLE DOMESTIC CHIT-CHAT.\n\nOne night, not long after the events narrated in the last chapter, Frank\nWillders was standing with the fireman-in-charge in the King Street\nStation.  He had just removed his helmet, and the perspiration on his\nbrow showed that he had been but recently engaged in some active duty;\nas indeed was the case, for he had just returned from a \"walk\" to a fire\nin Whitechapel.\n\n\"It was only a small affair,\" said Frank, hanging up his helmet and axe,\nand sitting down to fill his pipe; \"a low beer-shop in Brook Street; the\ntaproom burnt out, and the rest of the house damaged by smoke.  It was\npretty well over before I got there, and I left half an hour after.\nWhere are the rest o' the lads?\"\n\n\"They're out wi' both engines,\" said Baxmore, who was busy making a\nmemorandum on a slate.\n\n\"With both engines!\" said Frank.\n\n\"Ay, both,\" replied Baxmore, with a laugh, as he sat down in front of\nthe fire.  \"Let me see; it's now nine o'clock, so they've bin off an\nhour; one to Walton Street, Brompton; the other to Porchester Terrace,\nBayswater.  The call was the queerest I've seen for many a day.  We was\nall sittin' here smokin' our pipes, as usual, when two fellers came to\nthe door, full split, from opposite pints o' the compass, an' run slap\ninto each other.  They looked like gentlemen; but they was in such a\nstate it wasn't easy to make out what sort o' fish they was.  One had\nhis coat torn and his hat gone; the other had his tile pretty well\nknocked down on his eyes--I s'pose by the people he run into on the\nway--an' both were half-mad with excitement.  They both stuttered, too--\nthat was the fun o' the thing, and they seemed to think each was takin'\noff the other, and got into a most awful rage.  My own opinion is, that\none stuttered by nature, an' the other stuttered from fright.  Anyhow,\nthey both stuttered together, and a precious mess they made of it.\n\n\"\\`F-F-F-Fire!' roared one.\n\n\"\\`F-F-F-Fire!' yelled the other.\n\n\"\\`Where away?' asked Mr Dale, looking quietly at the two men, who were\ngasping for breath.\n\n\"\\`B-B-B-Brompton,' \\`B-B-B-Bayswater!' they shouted together; and then,\nturnin' fiercely on each other, the one said \\`N-N-N-No!' and the other\nsaid \\`N-N-N-No!'  \\`Now, _which_ is it?' said Dale, \\`an' _be_ quick--do.'\n\n\"\\`B-B-B-Brompton!'\n\n\"\\`B-B-B-Bayswater!' in a breath; then says one, \\`I--I s-s-say\n_Brompton_!' an' the other, he says, \\`I--I s-s-say _Bayswater_!'\n\n\"At this they grew furious, and Dale tried to calm them and settle the\nquestion by asking the name of the street.\n\n\"\\`W-W-Walton S-Street!' cried one.\n\n\"\\`P-P-P-Porchester T-T-Terrace!' shouted the other.\n\n\"\\`N-N-No!'  \\`Y-Y-Yes!'  \\`N-No!' an' with that, one up fist an' hit the\nother a crack between the eyes.  T'other returned on the nob, and then\nthey closed.\n\n\"Before this Mr Dale had ordered out one o' the engines, an' when he\nheard the two streets named it occurred to him that there might be _two_\nfires, so he ordered out the other engine; and before we got the\nstutterers separated both engines were off full swing, one to Brompton,\nthe other to Bayswater; but whether there are two fires or no is yet to\nbe seen.\"\n\nJust as Baxmore concluded, the rattle of a returning engine was heard.\nNext moment it dashed up to the door, and the firemen, leaping off,\nstreamed into the station, where; amid much comment and some laughter at\nthe scene they had so recently witnessed, they hung up their helmets and\ncrowded round the fire.\n\n\"So it _was_ in Brompton, after all,\" said Jack Williams, stirring the\ncoals; \"but it was a small affair in a baker's shop, and we soon got it\nout.\"\n\n\"Is the other engine back?\" inquired Moxey.\n\n\"Here she comes to answer for herself,\" said Mason, as the second engine\ndashed up to the station, and the men were joined by their comrades.\n\n\"We've got it out,\" said Dale, sitting down before the desk to enter the\nparticulars in his diary; \"it was a private house, and well alight when\nwe got there, but the Paddington engine was playing on it, and we soon\ngot it under.\"\n\n\"Faix, it's well them stutterers didn't kape us longer, else the whole\nhouse would have bin burnt out intirely,\" observed Joe Corney, binding\nup a slight wound in his thumb, which he had received from a splinter.\n\nMost of the men were more or less begrimed with charcoal and smoke, and\notherwise bore marks of their recent sharp though short skirmish, but\nnone of them deemed it necessary to remove these evidences of devotion\nto duty until they had refreshed themselves with a pipe.\n\n\"Were there people in the house?\" inquired Frank.\n\n\"Ay, but Pickford was there with the escape, an' got 'em all out before\nwe came up,\" said one.\n\n\"Pickford said he couldn't help laughing after he got 'em out, at the\nremembrance o' their faces.  When he first went in they was all sound\nasleep in the top floor, for the smoke was only beginnin' to show there,\nan' the surprise they got when he jump in among 'em an' shouted was\nwonderful to behold.\"\n\n\"Not so wonderful,\" observed Bill Moxey, \"as the surprise I seed a whole\nman-o'-war's crew get by consequence o' the shout o' one of her own\nmen.\"\n\n\"When was that?  Let's hear about it, Bill,\" said Corney, stuffing down\nthe tobacco in his pipe, and firing a battery of cloudlets into the air.\n\n\"We was in the Red Sea at the time,\" said Moxey, clearing his throat,\n\"layin' at anchor, and a precious hot time we had of it.  There was\nnever a cloud a'most in the sky, and the sun was nigh hot enough to fry\nthe decks off the ship.  Cook said he'd half a mind to try to roast a\njunk o' beef at it, but I never heard that he managed that.  We slep' on\ndeck o' nights, 'cause you might as well have tried to sleep in a\nbaker's oven as sleep below.  The thing that troubled us most at that\ntime was a tiger we had on board.  It did kick up such a shindy\nsometimes!  We thought it would break its cage an make a quid o' some of\nus.  I forget who sent it to us--p'raps it was the Pasha of Egypt;\nanyhow we weren't sorry when the order was given to put the tiger\nashore.\n\n\"Well, the same day that we got rid o' the tiger we was sent aboard a\nMalay ship to flog one o' the men.  He'n bin up to some mischief, an'\nhis comrades were afraid, I s'pose, to flog him; and as the offence he\nhad committed was against us somehow (I never rightly understood it\nmyself), some of us went aboard the Malay ship, tied him up, an' gave\nhim two dozen.\n\n\"That night the whole ship's company slep' on deck as usual--officers as\nwell--all but the cap'n, who had gone ashore.  It was a _tremendous_ hot\nnight, an' a good deal darker than usual.  There was one man in the ship\nnamed Wilson; but we called him Bob Roarer, because of a habit he had of\nspeakin' an' sometimes roarin' in his sleep.  Bob lay between me an' the\npurser that night, an' we slep' on all right till it was getting pretty\nlate, though there was two or three snorers that got their noses close\nto the deck an' kep' up a pretty fair imitation of a brass band.\nSuddenly Bob began to dream, or took a nightmare or somethin', for he\nhit straight out with both fists, givin' the purser a tap on the nob\nwith his left, an' diggin' his right into my bread-basket with such good\nwill that he nearly knocked all the wind out o' me, at the same time he\nuttered a most appallin' yell.\n\n\"The confusion that followed is past description.\n\n\"Some of us thought it was the tiger had broke loose,--forgettin' that\nit had been sent ashore.  Bob sneaked off the moment he found what he'd\ndone, and the purser, thinkin' it was pirates, grabbed the first he\ncould lay hold of by the throat, and that was me, so to it we went tooth\nan' nail, for I had no notion who was pitchin' into me, it was so dark.\nTwo of the men in their fright sprang up the main shrouds.  Two others,\nwho were asleep in the main-top, were awoke by the row, looked down on\nthe starboard side, an' saw the two comin' up.  Thinking it was the\nfriends of the Malay who had been flogged coming to be revenged, they\nran down the port shrouds like mad, and one o' them rushed along the\nport-deck, stickin' his feet into the bread-baskets of all the sleepers\nthat hadn't been woke by the yell, rousin' them up an' causin' them to\nroar like bo'suns.  The row woke the cook, who was a nigger; he,\nthinkin' it was a sudden jollification, seized one o' the coppers an'\nbegan to beat it with an iron spoon.  This set up the quartermaster, who\nrushed along the starboard deck, trampin' upon the breasts and faces of\nall and sundry.  The gunner thought it was the tiger, and took to the\ntop of the awning; while the doctor and bo's'n's-mate they jumped over\nthe side, and hung on by ropes up to their waists in water!\n\n\"At the worst o' the confusion the cap'n came aboard.  We didn't see\nhim, but he ordered silence, an' after a while we discovered that there\nwas no reason whatever for the shindy.  It wasn't till a long time\nafterwards that we found out the real cause of the false alarm; but the\nonly man that got no fright that night, and kep' quite cool, was the man\nwho set it all agoin'--Bob Roarer.\"\n\n\"_What_ a feller you are, Bill, to talk blarney,\" said Corney, rising\nand knocking the ashes out of his pipe; \"sure, aither yer father or yer\nmother must have bin an Irishman.\"\n\n\"Blarney or no blarney, them's the facts,\" said Moxey, yawning, \"an' I'm\noff to bed.\"\n\n\"Ditto,\" said Frank, stretching himself.\n\nThe two tressels, which were always removed from the room during the\nday, had been brought in, and were by this time occupied by Mason and\nWilliams, whose duty it was to keep watch that night.  Baxmore, the\nsub-engineer of the station, sat down at the desk to read over the\nevents of the day, and the others rose to leave.\n\n\"By the way, Baxmore,\" said Dale, \"what was that false alarm at 2 p.m.\nwhen I was down at Watling Street?\"\n\n\"Only a chemist in Kensington, who, it seems, is mad after makin'\nexperiments, and all but blew the roof off his house with one of 'em.\"\n\n\"Ah! only smoke, I suppose,\" said Dale.\n\n\"That was all,\" said Baxmore, \"but there was sitch a lot of it that some\nfellows thought it was a fire, an' came tearin' down here wi' the news,\nso we had a ride for nothing.\"\n\n\"If I'm not mistaken you'll have a ride for something ere long,\"\nobserved Dale, turning his head aside, while he listened attentively.\n\"Hold on, lads, a minute!\"\n\nThere was a sound of wheels in the distance, as if some vehicle were\napproaching at a furious pace.  On it came, louder and louder, until it\nturned the corner of the street, and the horses' feet rattled on the\nstones as they were pulled up sharp at the station.  Instantly the bell\nwas rung violently, and a severe kicking was bestowed on the door.\n\nIt is needless to say that the summons was answered promptly.  Some of\nthe men quietly resumed the helmets they had just hung up, well knowing\nthat work lay before them.\n\nA cabman darted through the door the instant it was opened, shouting--\n\n\"Fire!\"\n\n\"Where?\" asked Dale.\n\n\"Forth Street, Holborn, sir!\" cried the cabman.  Again, for the third\ntime that night, the order was given to \"get her out.\"  While this was\nbeing done, Baxmore took a leathern purse from the cupboard, and gave\nthe cabman a shilling for being first to \"give the call.\"\n\nAs the men were already accoutred, the engine left the station on this\noccasion in less than five minutes.  The distance was short, so the pace\nwas full speed, and in an incredibly short space of time they drew up in\nfront of a large, handsome shop, from the first-floor windows of which\nthick smoke and a few forked flames were issuing.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\n\nWILD DOINGS AND DARING DEEDS.\n\nQuick though they were, however, in reaching the scene of the fire, the\nescape was there before them.  It had a shorter way to travel, and was\nalready pitched, with its head resting against a window of the second\nfloor, and the fly ladder raised to the third.\n\nThe people who had crowded round the building at the first alarm of\nfire, were looking on as if in suspense, and the firemen knew that\nConductor Forest, or one of his lion-hearted comrades, was inside, doing\nhis noble and dangerous work.  But they had no time to pay attention to\nwhat was going on.\n\nWhile some of the firemen got the engine into play, the others ran in a\nbody to the front-door of the burning house, the lower part of which was\na coach-builder's warehouse.  It was a heavy double door, locked and\nbarred, and the owner had not yet arrived with the key.  It was evident\nthat the fire had originated in one of the upper floors, for there was\nno light in the wareroom.\n\n\"Get the pole-axe,\" said Dale, as soon as he found the door was fast.\n\nFrank Willders sprang off at the word, and returned with an axe of the\nlargest size attached to a handle nearly four feet long.\n\n\"Drive it in, Willders,\" said Dale.\n\nFrank's powerful blows at once thundered on the massive door; but they\nfell on it in vain, for it was unusually strong.  Seeing this, Dale ran\nback to the engine, and got out the pole.\n\n\"Come, lay hold some of you!\" said he.  Immediately eight firemen, Frank\nand Dale being at the front, charged the door like a thunderbolt with\nthis extemporised battering-ram.  It gave way with a prodigious crash,\nand the whole party fell over each other into the warehouse.\n\nThere was a burst of laughter from themselves, as well as from the\ncrowd; but in another moment they were up and swarming through the\npremises among the smoke, searching for a point of attack.\n\n\"Send the branch up here,\" cried Mason, coughing violently.\n\n\"Sure, my peepers is out entirely!\" gasped Corney, rushing to the window\nfor air; while showers of water fell on his head, for the engine was\nalready in full play.\n\nJust then there was a noise outside, as if men were disputing violently.\nDale guessed at once what it was, and ran down the staircase, calling\nout as he passed: \"Here, Willders, Corney, Baxmore, lend a hand, will\nyou?\"\n\nOn reaching the engine, they found about a dozen roughs of the lowest\ncharacter, disputing fiercely as to which of them was to pump the\nengine!  As each man received one shilling an hour for this work, it\nbecame a desirable means of earning a good night's wages to these\nbroad-shouldered rascals; who, in their anger, and in spite of the\npolice, and the solitary fireman who superintended the engine, had\nactually caused the men already at work to cease pumping.\n\nWe may remark in passing, that this would not have been the case, but\nfor the police force, from some unknown cause, being not very strong at\nthat fire, and having an excited and somewhat turbulent crowd to keep in\norder.  As a general rule, the police of London are of the most\nessential service at fires; and not a few of them have obtained the\nmedals of the Society for the protection of life from fire, and other\nrewards for gallantry displayed in saving life at the risk of their own\nlives.\n\nOn the present occasion, however, the few policemen present could barely\nhold their ground against such a band of stalwart desperadoes, so the\nfiremen came to the rescue.  In the front of the roughs stood a man who\nwas stronger made and better dressed than the others.  He had not been\npugnacious at first; but having got involved in the riot, he struck out\nwith the rest.  Dale sprang at this man, who was none other than the\nhalf-nautical individual already introduced to the reader by the name of\nGorman, and launched a left-hander at his head; but Gorman stepped\naside, and one of his comrades was felled instead.  At this, the others\nmade a rush in a body at Dale; but Frank, Corney, and Baxmore come up at\nthe moment, and each knocked down a man.  Instantly Dale seized an\ninstrument from the engine, named a \"preventer,\" like a large boat-hook,\nand, raising it at the full stretch of his powerful arms, he brought it\nswoop down on the heads of the roughs--six of whom, including Gorman,\nmeasured their length on the ground.\n\nMeanwhile, Bill Moxey and Jack Williams, who had charge of the branch--\nwhich is considered the post of honour at a fire--had paid no attention\nwhatever to this little episode; but the instant the order was given,\nhad conveyed their branch into the building, and up to the first floor,\nwhere they thought they could reach the fire more directly; for it is an\naxiom in fire brigades to get into a burning building _without delay_,\nand attack the fire at its heart.\n\nThey got the hose up a staircase, and began to play through a doorway at\nthe head of it; but, to their surprise, did not make any impression\nwhatever.  Two other engines, however, were at work by this time--so the\nfire was kept in check.\n\n\"Something wrong here,\" said Moxey, speaking with difficulty, owing to\nthe dense smoke.\n\nOwing to the same cause, it was impossible to see what was wrong.\n\n\"I'll go in an' see,\" said Mason, dropping on his hands and knees, and\ncreeping into the room with his mouth as close to the ground as\npossible.  This he did, because in a room on fire there is always a\ncurrent of comparatively fresh air at the floor.\n\nPresently the sound of Mason's small hatchet was heard cutting up\nwoodwork, and in a few seconds he rushed out almost choking.\n\n\"There,\" said he, \"stick the branch through that hole.  You've bin\nplayin' all this time up agin' a board partition!\"\n\nMoxey and Williams advanced, put the branch through the partition, and\nthe result was at once obvious in the diminution of smoke and increase\nof steam.\n\nWhile these incidents were occurring outside and inside the building,\nthe crowd was still waiting in breathless expectation for the\nre-appearance of Conductor Forest of the fire-escape; for the events\njust narrated, although taking a long time to tell, were enacted in a\nfew minutes.\n\nPresently Forest appeared at the window of the second floor with two\ninfants in his arms.  Instead of sending these down the canvas trough of\nthe escape in the usual way--at the risk of their necks, for they were\nvery young--he clasped them to his breast, and plunging into it himself\nhead-foremost, descended in that position, checking his speed by\nspreading out his knees against the sides of the canvas.  Once again he\nsprang up the escape amid the cheers of the people, and re-entered the\nwindow.\n\nAt that moment the attention of the crowd was diverted by the sudden\nappearance of a man at one of the windows of the first floor.\n\nHe was all on fire, and had evidently been aroused to his awful position\nunexpectedly, for he was in such confusion that he did not observe the\nfire-escape at the other window.  After shouting wildly for a few\nseconds, and tossing his arms in the air, he leaped out and came to the\nground with stunning violence.  Two policemen extinguished the fire that\nwas about him, and then, procuring a horse-cloth lifted him up tenderly\nand carried him away.\n\nIt may perhaps surprise the reader that this man was not roused sooner\nby the turmoil and noise that was going on around him, but it is a fact\nthat heavy sleepers are sometimes found by the firemen sound asleep, and\nin utter ignorance of what has been going on, long after a large portion\nof the houses in which they dwell have been in flames.\n\nWhen Forest entered the window the second time he found the smoke\nthicker than before, and had some difficulty in groping his way--for\nsmoke that may be breathed with comparative ease is found to be very\nsevere on the eyes.  He succeeded, however, in finding a woman lying\ninsensible on the floor of the room above.  In carrying her to the\nwindow he fell over a small child, which was lying on the floor in a\nstate of insensibility.  Grasping the latter with his left hand, he\nseized its night-dress with his teeth, and, with the woman on his\nshoulder, appeared on the top of the fly-ladder, which he descended in\nsafety.\n\nThe cheers and shouts of the crowd were deafening as Forest came down;\nbut the woman, who had begun to recover, said that her brother was in a\nloft above the room in which she had been found.\n\nThe Conductor, therefore, went up again, got on the roof of the house,\nbroke through the tiles, and with much difficulty pulled the man through\nthe aperture and conveyed him safely to the ground.  [See note 1].\n\nThe firemen were already at Forest's heels, and as soon as he dragged\nthe man through the hole in the roof, Frank and Baxmore jumped into it\nwith the branch, and immediately attacked the fire.\n\nBy this time all the engines of the district in which the fire had\noccurred, and one from each of the two adjoining districts, had arrived,\nand were in full play, and one by one the individual men from the\ndistant stations came dropping in and reported themselves to Dale, Mr\nBraidwood not being present on that occasion.  There was thus a strong\nforce of fresh firemen on the ground, and these, as they came up, were\nsent--in military parlance--to relieve skirmishers.  The others were\ncongregated in front of the door, moving quietly about, looking on and\nchatting in undertones.\n\nSuch of the public as arrived late at the fire no doubt formed a very\nerroneous impression in regard to these men, for not only did they\nappear to be lounging about doing nothing, but they were helped by one\nof their number to a glass of brandy--such of them at least as chose to\ntake it.  But those who had witnessed the fire from the beginning knew\nthat these men had toiled, with every nerve and muscle strained, for\nupwards of an hour in the face of almost unbearable heat,\nhalf-suffocated by smoke, and drenched by hot water.  They were resting\nnow, and they had much need of rest, for some of them had come out of\nthe burning house almost fainting from exposure to heat and smoke.\nIndeed, Mason _had_ fainted; but the fresh air soon revived him, and\nafter a glass of brandy he recovered sufficiently to be fit for duty\nagain in half an hour.\n\nFrank and Baxmore were the last to be relieved.  When two fresh men came\nup and took the branch they descended the stairs, and a strange descent\nit was.  The wooden stair, or flight of open steps, which they had to\ndescend first, was burnt to charcoal, and looked as if it would fall to\npieces with a touch.\n\n\"I hope it'll bear,\" said Frank to Baxmore, who went first.\n\n\"Bear or not bear, we _must_ go down,\" said Baxmore.\n\nHe went unhesitatingly upon it, and although the steps bent ominously,\nthere was enough of sound wood to sustain him.\n\nThe second stair, also of wood, had not been quite so much charred; but\nso great was the quantity of water poured continuously into the house,\nthat it formed a regular water-course of the staircase, down which heaps\nof plaster and bricks and burnt rubbish had been washed, and had stuck\nhere and there, forming obstructions on which the water broke and round\nwhich it roared in the form of what might have been a very respectable\nmountain-torrent, with this striking difference, that the water which\nrushed down it was _hot_, in consequence of its having passed through\nsuch glowing materials.\n\nThe lower staircase was a stone one--the worst of all stairs in a fire,\nowing to its liability to crack at its connection with the wall, from\nthe combined influence of heat and cold water.  Just as the two men\nreached the head of it, it fell, without warning, in a mass of ruins.\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Baxmore, \"the fire-escape is still at the window.\"\n\nSo saying, he ran through the smoke and reached it.  Frank was about to\nfollow, when he observed a shut door.  Without having any definite\nintention, he laid hold of the handle, and found that it was locked on\nthe inside--he knew that, for he saw the end of the key sticking through\nthe key-hole.  At once he threw his weight on it, and burst it open.  To\nhis amazement, he found a little old lady sitting quietly, but in great\ntrepidation, in an easy-chair, partially clothed in very scanty\ngarments, which she had evidently thrown on in great haste.\n\n\"Go away, young man!\" she screamed, drawing a shawl tightly round her.\n\"Go away, I say! how _dare_ you, sir?\"\n\n\"Why, ma'am,\" cried Frank, striding up to her; \"the house is on fire!\nCome, I'll carry you out.\"\n\n\"No--No!\" she cried, pushing him resolutely away.  \"What! carry me--me\nout _thus_!  I know it's on fire.  Leave me, sir, I command you--I\nentreat you; I will die rather than appear as I am--in public.\"\n\nThe poor lady finished off with a loud shriek; for Frank, seeing how\nmatters stood, and knowing there was not a moment to lose, plucked a\nblanket from the bed, overwhelmed her in it, and exclaiming, \"Forgive\nme, ma'am,\" lifted her gently in his arms, bore her through the smoke,\ndown the escape, to the street; carried her into a neighbouring house\n(the door of which was opportunely open), and laid her like a bundle on\none of the beds, where he left her, with strict injunctions to the\npeople of the house to take care of her!  Frank then went out to rejoin\nhis comrades, and refreshed himself with a glass of beer; while Baxmore,\nbeing a teetotaller, recruited his energies with a glass of water.\n\nBy this time the fire had been pretty well subdued; but there were some\nparts smouldering about the roof and upper floor, that rendered it\nnecessary to keep the engines going, while the firemen hunted their foe\nfrom room to room, and corner to corner--extinguishing him everywhere;\nnot, however, before he had completely gutted the whole house, with the\nexception of part of the ground floor.\n\n\"Keep away from the walls, men,\" said Dale, coming up to the group, who\nwere resting.\n\nAt that moment there was a cry raised that some one was in the cellars.\n\nAt the word, Baxmore ran into the house, and descended to the basement.\nThere was little smoke here; but from the roof, water was running down\nin a thick, warm shower, which drenched him in a few minutes.  He ran\nthrough the whole place, but found no one, until he opened the door of a\ncloset, when he discovered two old women who had taken refuge there; one\nbeing deaf and the other lame, as her crutches testified.  They were up\nto the knees in water, and the same element was pouring in continuous\nstreams on their heads--yet, like the old lady up-stairs, they refused\nto move or be moved.\n\nFinding that persuasion was useless, Baxmore ran up for a horse-cloth,\nand, returning, threw it over the head of the deaf old woman, whom he\nbore, kicking violently, into the street.  The other was carried out in\nthe same fashion--only that she screamed violently, being unable to\nkick.\n\nSoon after that, the fire was completely extinguished, and the engines\nand men returned to their several stations, leaving London once again in\ncomparative repose.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote 1.  It is perhaps right to state here, that a deed similar to this\nin nearly every point was performed by Conductor Samuel Wood, a member\nof the London Fire-Escape Brigade, for which he received a testimonial\nsigned by the then Lord Mayor, and a silver watch with 20 pounds from\nthe inhabitants of Whitechapel.  Wood saved nearly 200 lives by his own\npersonal exertions.  Many of his brave comrades have also done deeds\nthat are well worthy of record, but we have not space to do more than\nallude to them here.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\n\nJOE CORNEY'S ADVENTURE WITH GHOSTS.\n\nWhen we said that the firemen returned to their respective stations, it\nmust not be supposed that the house which had been burnt was left in\nforlorn wretchedness.  No; one of the firemen remained to watch over it,\nand guard against the upstarting of any sneaking spark that might have\nmanaged to conceal itself.\n\nThe man selected for this duty was Joe Corney.\n\nUnfortunately for Joe, this was the only part of a fireman's duty that\nhe did not relish.\n\nJoe Corney was, both by nature and education, very superstitious.  He\nbelieved implicitly in ghosts, and knew an innumerable host of persons,\nmale and female, who had seen people who said they had seen ghosts.  He\nwas too honest to say he had ever seen a ghost himself; but he had been\n\"very near seein' wan two or three times,\" and he lived in perpetual\nexpectation and dread of meeting one face to face before he died.  Joe\nwas as brave as a lion, and faced danger, and sometimes even what\nappeared to be certain death, with as much unflinching courage as the\nbravest of his comrades.  Once, in particular, he had walked with the\nbranch in his hands along the burning roof of a tottering warehouse,\nnear the docks, in order to gain a point from which he could play on the\nflames so as to prevent them spreading to the next warehouse, and so\ncheck a fire which might have easily become one of the \"great fires of\nLondon.\"\n\nJoe was therefore a man who could not be easily frightened; yet Joe\ntrembled in his shoes when he had the most distant prospect of meeting\nwith a ghost!\n\nThere was no help for it, however.  He had been appointed to watch the\nruin; and, being a man who cherished a strong sense of duty, he set\nhimself doggedly to make the most of his circumstances.\n\nIt was past one o'clock when the fire was finally extinguished.  A few\nnight-birds and late revellers still hung about it, as if in the hope\nthat it would burst forth again, and afford them fresh excitement; but\nbefore two o'clock, everyone had gone away, and Joe was left alone with\nhis \"preventer\" and lantern.  Even the policeman on the beat appeared to\navoid him; for, although he passed the ruin at regular intervals in his\nrounds, he did not stop at it beyond a few moments, to see that the\nfireman's lantern was burning and all right.\n\n\"Corney, me lad,\" said Joe to himself, \"it's bad luck has befallen ye\nthis night; but face yer luck like a man now, and shame it.\"\n\nEncouraging himself thus, he grasped his preventer, and pulled about the\n_debris_ in various places of which he had some suspicion; but the\nengines had done their work so effectually that not a spark remained.\nThen Joe walked up and down, and in and out for an hour; studied the\nhalf-consumed pictures that still hung on the walls of one of the lower\nrooms, which had not been completely destroyed; moralised on the dire\nconfusion and ruin that could be accomplished in so short a space of\ntime; reflected on the probable condition of the unfortunates who had\nbeen burnt out; on the mutability of human affairs in general, and\nwondered what his \"owld mother\" would think of him, if she saw him in\nhis forlorn situation.\n\nThis latter thought caused his mind to revert to ghosts; but he was\ncomforted by hearing the slow, distant foot-fall of the policeman.  On\nit came, not unlike the supposed step of an unearthly visitant, until\nthe guardian of the night stood revealed before him on the other side of\nthe road.\n\n\"It's a cowld night intirely,\" cried Corney.\n\n\"It is,\" responded the policeman.\n\n\"How goes the inimy?\" inquired the fireman.\n\n\"Just gone three,\" replied the other.\n\nThe policeman's voice, although gruff, was good-humoured and hearty; but\nhe was evidently a strict disciplinarian, for he uttered no other word,\nand passed on.\n\n\"Faix, I'm gettin' slaipy,\" remarked Joe to himself, with a loud yawn.\n\"I'll go and rest a bit.\"\n\nSo saying, he re-entered the ruin, and with the aid of his lantern\nsought about for the least uncomfortable apartment on the ground floor.\nHe selected one which was comparatively weather-tight.  That is to say,\nonly one of the windows had been dashed out, and the ceiling was entire,\nwith the exception of a hole about four feet wide, through which the\ncharred beams above could be seen depicted against the black sky.  There\nwas about an inch of water on the floor; but this was a small matter,\nfor Joe's boots were thick and strong.  The door, too, had been burst\noff its hinges, and lay on the floor; but Joe could raise this, and\nplace it in its original position.\n\nThe room had been a parlour and there were several damaged prints\nhanging on the walls, besides a quantity of detached paper hanging from\nthem.  Most of the furniture had been removed at the commencement of the\nfire; but a few broken articles remained, and one big old easy-chair,\nwhich had either been forgotten, or deemed unworthy of removal, by the\nmen of the Salvage Corps.  [See note 1.]\n\nJoe wheeled the chair to the fireplace--not that there was any fire in\nit; on the contrary, it was choked up with fallen bricks and mortar, and\nthe hearth was flooded with water; but, as Joe remarked to himself, \"it\nfelt more homelike an' sociable to sit wid wan's feet on the finder!\"\n\nHaving erected the door in front of its own doorway, Joe leaned his\npreventer against the wall, placed his lantern on the chimney-piece, and\nsat down to meditate.  He had not meditated long, when the steady\ndraught of air from the window at his back began to tell upon him.\n\n\"Och! but it's a cowld wind,\" said he.  \"I'll try the other side.\nThere's nothin' like facin' wan's inimies.\"\n\nActing on this idea, he changed his position, turning his face to the\nwindow and his back to the door.\n\n\"Well,\" he remarked on sitting down again, \"there's about as much\ndraught from the door; but, sure, ye've improved yer sitivation, Corney,\nfor haven't ye the illigant prospect of over the way through the windy?\"\n\nNot long after this, Joe's mind became much affected with ghostly\nmemories.  This condition was aggravated by an intense desire to sleep,\nfor the poor man had been hard worked that day, and stood much in need\nof repose.  He frequently fell asleep, and frequently awoke.  On falling\nasleep, his helmet performed extremely undignified gyrations.  On\nawaking, he always started, opened his eyes very wide, looked round\ninquiringly, then smiled, and resumed a more easy position.  But, awake\nor asleep, his thoughts ran always in the same channel.\n\nDuring one of those waking moments, Joe heard a sound which rooted him\nto his seat with horror; and would doubtless have caused his hair to\nstand on end, if the helmet would have allowed it.  The sound was simple\nenough in itself, however; being slight, slow, and regular, and was only\nhorrible in Joe's mind, because of his being utterly unable to account\nfor it, or to conceive what it could be.\n\nWhatever the sound was, it banished sleep from his eyes for at least a\nquarter of an hour.  At last, unable to stand the strain of uncertainty,\nhe arose, drew his hatchet, took down his lantern, and, coughing loudly\nand sternly--as though to say:\n\n\"Have a care, I'm coming!\"--removed the door and went cautiously into\nthe passage, where the sound appeared to come from.  It did not cease on\nhis appearing; but went on slowly and steadily, and louder than before.\nIt appeared to be at his very elbow; yet Joe could see nothing, and a\ncold perspiration broke out on him.\n\n\"Och! av I could only _see_ it!\" he gasped.\n\nJust as he said this he _did_ see it, for a turn of his lantern revealed\nthe fact that a drop of water fell regularly from one of the burnt beams\nupon a large sheet of paper which had been torn from the passage wall.\nThis, resting on the irregular rubbish, formed a sort of drum, which\ngave forth a hollow sound.\n\n\"Ah, then, but ye _are_ a goose, Joe Corney, me boy!\" said the fireman,\nas he turned away with an amiable smile and resumed his seat after\nreplacing the door.\n\nAbout this time the wind began to rise, and came in irregular gusts.  At\neach gust the door was blown from the wall an inch or so, and fell back\nwith a noise that invariably awoke Joe with a start.  He looked round\neach time quickly; but as the door remained quiet he did not discover\nthe cause of his alarm.  After it had done this several times Joe\nbecame, so to speak, desperately courageous.\n\n\"Git out wid ye!\" he cried angrily on being startled again, \"wasn't the\nlast wan all a sham? an' sure ye're the same.  Go 'long in pace--an'\ngoodnight!\"\n\nAs he said this the over-taxed man fell asleep; at the same moment a\nheavy gust of wind drove the door in altogether, and dashed it down on\nhis head.  Fortunately, being somewhat charred, the panel that struck\nhis helmet was driven out, so that Joe came by no greater damage than\nthe fright, which caused his heart to bound into his throat, for he\nreally believed that the ghost had got him at last!\n\nRelieving himself of the door, which he laid on the floor lest it should\nplay him the same prank over again, Joe Corney once more settled himself\nin the easy-chair and resolved to give his mind to meditation.  Just\nthen the City clocks pealed forth the hour of four o'clock.\n\nThis is perhaps the quietest hour of the twenty-four in London.  Before\nthis most of the latest revellers have gone home, and few of the early\nrisers are moving.\n\nThere was one active mind at work at that hour, however--namely, that of\nGorman--who, after recovering from the blow given him by Dale, went to\nhis own home on the banks of the Thames, in the unaristocratic locality\nof London Bridge.\n\nGorman owned a small boat, and did various kinds of business with it.\nBut Gorman's occupations were numerous and not definite.  He was\neverything by turns, and nothing long.  When visible to the outward eye\n(and that wasn't often), his chief occupations were loafing about and\ndrinking.  On the present occasion he drank a good deal more than usual,\nand lay down to sleep, vowing vengeance against firemen in general, and\nDale in particular.\n\nTwo or three hours later he awoke, and leaving his house, crossed London\nBridge, and wended his way back to the scene of the fire without any\ndefinite intention, but with savage desires in his breast.  He reached\nit just at that point where Joe Corney had seated himself to meditate,\nas above described.\n\nJoe's powers of meditation were not great at any time.  At that\nparticular time they were exerted in vain, for his head began to sway\nbackward and forward and to either side, despite his best efforts to the\ncontrary.\n\nWaiting in the shadow of a doorway until the policeman should pass out\nof sight and hearing, and cautiously stepping over the debris that\nencumbered the threshold of the burnt house, Gorman peeped into the\nroom, where the light told him that some one kept watch.  Great was his\nsatisfaction and grim his smile when he saw that a stalwart fireman sat\nthere apparently asleep.  Being only able to see his back, he could not\nmake certain who it was,--but from the bulk of the man and breadth of\nthe shoulders he concluded that it was Dale.  Anyhow it was one of his\nenemies, and that was sufficient, for Gorman's nature was of that brutal\nkind that he would risk his life any day in order to gratify his\nvengeance, and it signified little to him which of his enemies fell in\nhis way, so long as it was one of them.\n\nTaking up a brick from the floor, he raised himself to his full height,\nand dashed it down on the head of the sleeping man.  Just at that moment\nCorney's nodding head chanced to fall forward, and the brick only hit\nthe comb of his helmet, knocking it over his eyes.  Next moment he was\ngrappling with Gorman.\n\nAs on previous occasions, Joe's heart had leaped to his throat, and that\nthe ghost was upon him \"at last\" he had no manner of doubt; but no\nsooner did he feel the human arm of Gorman and behold his face than his\nnative courage returned with a bound.  He gave his antagonist a squeeze\nthat nearly crushed his ribs together, and at the same time hurled him\nagainst the opposite wall.  But Gorman was powerful and savage.  He\nrecovered himself and sprang like a tiger on Joe, who received him in a\nwarm embrace with an Irish yell!\n\nThe struggle of the two strong men was for a few moments terrible, but\nnot doubtful, for Joe's muscles had been brought into splendid training\nat the gymnastics.  He soon forced Gorman down on one knee; but at the\nsame moment a mass of brickwork which had been in a toppling condition,\nand was probably shaken down by the violence of their movements, fell on\nthe floor above, broke through it, and struck both men to the ground.\n\nJoe lay stunned and motionless for a few seconds, for a beam had hit him\non the head; but Gorman leaped up and made off a moment or two before\nthe entrance of the policeman, who had run back to the house on hearing\nJoe's war-whoop.\n\nIt is needless to add that Joe spent the remainder of his vigil that\nnight in an extremely wakeful condition, and that he gave a most graphic\naccount of his adventure with the ghosts on his return to the station!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote 1.  The Salvage Corps is a body of men appointed by the insurance\noffices to save and protect goods at fires, and otherwise to watch over\ntheir interests.  They wear a uniform and helmets, something like those\nof the firemen, and generally follow close in their wake--in their own\nvans--when fires break out.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\n\nA NEW PHASE OF LIFE.\n\n\"Mother,\" said Master William Willders one night to his parent, as he\nsat at supper--which meal consisted of bread and milk; \"he's the\njolliest old feller, that Mr Tippet, I ever came across.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you like him, Willie,\" said Mrs Willders, who was busy\npatching the knees of a pair of small unmentionables; \"but I wish, dear,\nthat you would not use slang in your speech, and remember that fellow is\nnot spelt with an e-r at the end of it.\"\n\n\"Come now, mother, don't you go an' get sarcastic.  It don't suit you;\nbesides, there's no occasion for it,--for I do my best to keep it down,\nbut I'm so choke full of it that a word or two will spurt up now and\nthen in spite o' me.\"\n\nMrs Willders smiled and continued her patching; Willie grinned and\ncontinued his supper.\n\n\"Mother,\" said Willie, after an interval of silence.\n\n\"Well, my son?\"\n\n\"What d'ye think the old feller--ah!  I mean fellow--is up to just now?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Willie.\"\n\n\"He's inventin' a calc'latin' machine, as is to do anythin' from simple\naddition to fractions, an' he says if it works well he'll carry it on to\nalgebra an' mathematics, up to the fizmal calc'lus, or somethin' o' that\nsort.  Oh, you've no notion how he strains himself at it.  He sits down\nin his shirt-sleeves at a writin'-table he's got in a corner, an' tears\naway at the little hair he has on the sides of his head (I do believe he\ntore it all off the top with them inventions), then he bangs up an'\nseizes his tools, and shouts, \\`Look here, Willie, hold on!' an' goes\nsawin' and chisellin' and hammerin' away like a steam-engine.  He's all\nbut bu'st himself over that calc'latin' machine, and I'm much afraid\nthat he'll clap Chips into the sausage-machine some day, just to see how\nit works.  I hope he won't, for Chips an' I are great friends, though\nwe've only bin a month together.\"\n\n\"I hope he's a good man,\" said Mrs Willders thoughtfully.\n\n\"Well, I'm sure he must be!\" cried Willie with enthusiasm, \"for he is\nvery kind to me, and also to many poor folk that come about him\nregularly.  I'm gettin' to know their faces now, and when to expect 'em.\nHe always takes 'em into his back room--all sorts, old men and old\nwomen an' children, most of 'em seedy enough, but some of 'em well off\nto _look_ at.  What he says to 'em I don't know, but they usually come\nout very grave, an go away thankin' him, and sayin' they won't forget\nhis advice.  If the advice is to come back soon they certainly _don't_\nforget it!  And he's a great philosopher, too, mother, for he often\ntalks to me about my int'lec's.  He said jist t'other day, \\`Willie,'\nsaid he, \\`get into a habit o' usin' yer brains, my boy.  The Almighty\nput us into this world well-made machines, intended to be used in all\nour parts.  Now, you'll find thousands of people who use their muscles\nand neglect their brains, and thousands of others who use their brains\nand neglect their muscles.  Both are wrong, boy; we're machines, lad--\nwonderful machines--and the machines won't work well if they're not used\n_all_ over.'  Don't that sound grand, mother?\"\n\nWillie might have received an answer if he had waited for one, but he\nwas too impatient, and went rattling on.\n\n\"And who d'ye think, mother, came to see old Tippet the other day, but\nlittle Cattley, the clown's boy.  You remember my tellin' you about\nlittle Cattley and the auction, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, Willie.\"\n\n\"Well, he came, and just as he was goin' away I ran out an' asked him\nhow the fairy was.  \\`She's very ill,' he said, shakin' his head, and\nlookin' so mournful that I had not the heart to ask more.  But I'm goin'\nto see them, mother.\"\n\n\"That's right, my boy,\" said Mrs Willders, with a pleased look; \"I like\nto hear you talk of going to see people in distress.  \\`Blessed are they\nthat consider the poor,' Willie.\"\n\n\"Oh, as to that, you know, I don't know that they _are_ poor.  Only I\nfeel sort o' sorry for 'em, somehow, and I'm awful anxious to see a real\nlive fairy, even though she _is_ ill.\"\n\n\"When are you going?\" inquired Mrs Willders.\n\n\"To-morrow night, on my way home.\"\n\n\"Did you look in at Frank's lodging in passing to-night?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did, and found that he was in the station on duty again.  It\nwasn't a bad sprain, you see, an' it'll teach him not to go jumpin' out\nof a first-floor window again.\"\n\n\"He couldn't help it,\" said the widow.  \"You know his escape by the\nstair had been cut off, and there was no other way left.\"\n\n\"No other way!\" cried Willie; \"why didn't he _drop_?  He's so proud of\nhis strength, is Blazes, that he jumped off-hand a' purpose to show it!\nHa! he'd be the better of some o' my caution.  Now, mother, I'm off to\nbed.\"\n\n\"Get the Bible, then,\" said Mrs Willders.\n\nWillie got up and fetched a large old family Bible from a shelf, and\nlaid it on the table before his mother, who read a chapter and prayed\nwith her son; after which Willie gave her one of his \"roystering\" kisses\nand went to bed.\n\nThe lamps had been lighted for some time next night, and the\nshop-windows were pouring forth their bright rays, making the streets\nappear as light as day, when Willie found himself in the small\ndisreputable street near London Bridge in which Cattley the clown dwelt.\n\nRemembering the directions given to him by little Jim Cattley, he soon\nfound the underground abode near the burnt house, the ruins of which had\nalready been cleared away and a considerable portion of a new tenement\nerected.\n\nIf the stair leading to the clown's dwelling was dark, the passage at\nthe foot of it was darker; and as Willie groped his way carefully along,\nhe might have imagined it to be a place inhabited only by rats or cats,\nhad not gleams of light, and the sound of voices from sundry closed\ndoors, betokened the presence of human beings.  Of the compound smells\npeculiar to the place, those of beer and tobacco predominated.\n\nAt the farther end of this passage, there was an abrupt turn to the\nleft, which brought the boy unexpectedly to a partially open door, where\na scene so strange met his eyes that he involuntarily stood still and\ngazed.\n\nIn a corner of the room, which was almost destitute of furniture, a\nlittle girl, wan, weary, and thin, lay on a miserable pallet, with\nscanty covering over her.  Beside her stood Cattley--not, as when first\nintroduced, in a seedy coat and hat; but in full stage costume--with\nthree balls on his head, white face, triangular roses on his cheeks, and\nhis mouth extended outward and upward at the corners, by means of red\npaint.  Little Jim sat on the bed beside his sister, clad in pink\nskin-tights, with cheeks and face similar to his father, and a red crest\nor comb of worsted on his head.\n\n\"Ziza, darling, are you feeling better, my lamb?\" said the elder clown,\nwith a gravity of expression in his real mouth that contrasted strangely\nwith the expression conveyed by the painted corners.\n\n\"No, father, not much; but perhaps I'm gettin' better, though I don't\nfeel it,\" said the sweet, faint voice of the child, as she opened her\nlarge hollow eyes, and looked upward.\n\n\"So, that's the fairy!\" thought Willie sadly, as he gazed on the child's\nbeautiful though wasted features.\n\n\"We'll have done d'rectly, darling,\" said the clown tenderly; \"only one\nmore turn, and then we'll leave you to rest quietly for some hours.\nNow, then, here we are again!\" he added, bounding into the middle of the\nroom with a wild laugh.  \"Come along, Jim, try that jump once more.\"\n\nJim did not speak; but pressing his lips to his sister's brow, leaped\nafter his sire, who was standing an a remarkably vigorous attitude, with\nhis legs wide apart and his arms akimbo, looking back over his shoulder.\n\n\"Here we go,\" cried Jim in a tiny voice, running up his father's leg and\nside, stepping lightly on his shoulder, and planting one foot on his\nhead.\n\n\"Jump down,\" said the clown gravely.\n\nJim obeyed.\n\n\"That won't do, Jim.  You must do it all in one run; no pausing on the\nway--but, whoop! up you go, and both feet on my head at once.  Don't be\nafeard; you can't tumble, you know.\"\n\n\"I'm not afeard, father,\" said Jim; \"but I ain't quite springy in my\nheart to-night.  Stand again and see if I don't do it right off.\"\n\nCattley the elder threw himself into the required attitude; and Cattley\njunior, rushed at him, ran up him as a cat runs up a tree, and in a\nmoment was standing on his father's head with his arms extended.\nWhoop!--next moment he was turning round in the air; and whoop! in\nanother moment he was standing on the ground, bowing respectfully to a\nsupposed audience.\n\nTo Jim's immense amazement, the supposed audience applauded him\nheartily; and said, \"Bravyo! young 'un,\" as it stepped into the room, in\nthe person of William Willders.\n\n\"Why! who may _you_ be?\" inquired the clown senior, stepping up to the\nintruder.\n\nBefore Willie could answer the clown junior sprang on his father's\nshoulders, and whispered in his ear.  Whatever he said, the result was\nan expression of benignity and condescension on the clown's face--as far\nas paint would allow of such expression.\n\n\"Glad to meet you, Master Willders,\" he said.  \"Proud to know anyone\nconnected with T. Tippet, Esquire, who's a trump.  Give us your flipper.\nWhat may be the object of your unexpected, though welcome visit to this\nthis subterraneous grotto, which may be said to be next door to the\ncoral caves, where the mermaids dwell.\"\n\n\"Yes, and there's one o' the mermaids singing,\" remarked the clown\njunior, with a comical leer, as a woman's voice was heard in violent\naltercation with some one.  \"She's a sayin' of her prayers now;\nbeseechin' of her husband to let her have her own way.\"\n\nWillie explained that, having had the pleasure of meeting with Jim at an\nauction sale some weeks ago, he had called to renew his acquaintance;\nand Jim said he remembered the incident--and that, if he was not\nmistaken, a desire to see a live fairy in plain clo'se, with her wings\noff, had something to do with his visit.\n\n\"Here she is;--by the way, what's your name?\"\n\n\"Bill Willders.\"\n\n\"Here she is, Bill; this is the fairy,\" he said, in quite an altered\ntone, as he went to the bed, and took one of his sister's thin hands in\nboth of his.  \"Ziza, this is the feller I told ye of, as wanted to see\nyou, dear; b'longs to Mr Tippet.\"\n\nZiza smiled faintly, as she extended her hand to Willie, who took it and\npressed it gently.\n\nWillie felt a wonderfully strong sensation within his heart as he looked\ninto the sufferer's large liquid eyes; and for a few seconds he could\nnot speak.  Suddenly he exclaimed, \"Well, you ain't one bit like what I\nexpected to see.  You're more like a angel than a fairy.\"\n\nZiza smiled again, and said she didn't feel like either the one or the\nother.\n\n\"My poor lamb,\" said the clown, sitting down on the bed, and parting the\ndark hair on Ziza's forehead, with a hand as gentle as that of a mother,\n\"we're goin' now.  Time's up.  Shall I ask Mrs Smith to stay with you\nagain, till we come back?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no!\" cried the child hurriedly, and squeezing her fingers into\nher eyes, as if to shut out some disagreeable object.  \"Not Mrs Smith.\nI'd rather be alone.\"\n\n\"I _wish_ I could stay with you, Ziza,\" said Jim earnestly.\n\n\"It's of no use wishin', Jim,\" said his father, \"you can't get off a\nsingle night.  If you was to fail 'em you'd lose your engagement, and we\ncan't afford that just at this time, you know; but I'll try to get Mrs\nJames to come.  She's a good woman, I know, and--\"\n\n\"Mister Cattley,\" interrupted Willie, \"if you'll allow a partic'larly\nhumble individual to make a observation, I would say there's nothin' in\nlife to prevent me from keeping this 'ere fairy company till you come\nback.  I've nothin' particular to do as I knows on, an' I'm raither fond\nof lonely meditation; so if the fairy wants to go to sleep, it'll make\nno odds to me, so long's it pleases her.\"\n\n\"Thankee, lad,\" said the clown; \"but you'll git wearied, I fear, for we\nwon't be home till mornin'--\"\n\n\"Ah!\" interrupted Willie, \"till daylight does appear.  But that's no\nodds, neither--'cause I'm not married yet, so there's nobody awaitin'\nfor me--and\" (he winked to Jim at this point) \"my mother knows I'm out.\"\n\nThe clown grinned at this.  \"You'd make one of _us_, youngster,\" said\nhe, \"if ye can jump.  Howsever, I'm obliged by your offer, so you can\nstay if Ziza would like it.\"\n\nZiza said she _would_ like it with such goodwill, that Willie adored her\nfrom that moment, and vowed in his heart he would nurse her till she--he\ndid not like to finish the sentence; yet, somehow, the little that he\nhad heard and seen of the child led him irresistibly to the conclusion\nthat she was dying.\n\nThis having been satisfactorily arranged, the Cattleys, senior and\njunior, threw cloaks round them, exchanged their wigs for caps; and,\nregardless of the absurd appearance of their faces, hurried out to one\nof the minor theatres, with heavy hearts because of the little fairy\nleft so ill and comfortless at home.\n\nIn a few minutes they were tumbling on the stage, cracking their jokes,\nand convulsing the house with laughter.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\n\nWILLIE IN A NEW LIGHT.\n\nLeft alone with the fairy, Willie Willders began his duties as\nsick-nurse, a sphere of action into which he had never thought of being\nintroduced, even in his wildest dreams.\n\nHe began by asking the fairy if she was all right and comfortable, to\nwhich she replied that she was not; upon which he explained that he\nmeant, was she as right and comfortable as could be expected in the\ncircumstances; could he do anything for her, in fact, or get her\nanything that would make her more comfortable than she was--but the\nfairy shook her poor head and said, \"No.\"\n\n\"Come now, won't you have somethin' to eat?  What had you for dinner?\"\nsaid Willie, in a cheery voice, looking round the room, but not\ndiscovering any symptoms of food beyond a few empty plates and cups (the\nlatter without handles), and a tea-pot with half a spout.\n\n\"I had a little bread and butter,\" said the fairy.\n\n\"No tipple?\" inquired the nurse.\n\n\"No, except water.\"\n\n\"Ain't there none in the house?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"D'ye git nothin' better at other times?\" inquired Willie in surprise.\n\n\"Not often.  Father is very poor.  He was ill for a long time, too, and\nif it hadn't been for your kind master I think we should all have\nstarved.  He's better now, but he needs pretty good living to keep him\nup to his work--for there's a deal of training to be done, and it wears\nhim out if he don't get meat.  But the pantomimes began and we were\ngetting on better, when the fire came and burnt everything we had\nalmost, so we can't afford much meat or beer, and I don't like beer, so\nI've got them persuaded to let me live on bread and butter and water.  I\nwould like tea better, because it's hot, but we can't afford that.\"\n\nHere was a revelation!  The fairy lived upon bread and butter and water!\nWillie thought that, but for the interpolation of the butter, it would\nhave borne marvellous resemblance to prison fare.\n\n\"When had you dinner?\" inquired Willie suddenly.\n\n\"I think about four o'clock.\"\n\n\"An' can't you eat nothin' now?\"\n\nAgain the fairy shook her head.\n\n\"Nor drink?\"\n\n\"Look if there's anything in the tea-pot,\" said the fairy.\n\nWillie looked, shook his head, and said, \"Not a drop.\"\n\n\"Any leaves?\"\n\n\"Why, y-yes,\" he brought the pot nearer to the candle; \"there are a few\nused-up ones.\"\n\n\"Oh, _do_ pour some hot water into it; but I fear the water is cold, and\nthe fire's too low to boil it, and I know the coals are done; but father\ngets paid his salary to-morrow, and he'll give me some tea then.  He's\nvery kind to me, father is, and so is Jim.\"\n\nShe sighed as she spoke, and shut her eyes.\n\n\"Ziza,\" said Willie in a careless tone, \"you won't object to my leavin'\nyou for a few minutes; only a few; I want to get a little fresh air, an'\nsee what sort of a night it is; I won't be long gone.\"\n\nZiza, so far from objecting, said that she was used to being left alone\nfor long, long hours at a time, and wouldn't mind it.  So Willie put the\ncandle nearer to her bedside, placed a tea-cup of water within reach,\nwent out, shut the door softly behind him, groped his way through the\npassage and up the stair, and got into the street.\n\nThat day his eccentric employer had paid him his first month's wage, a\nsovereign, with many complimentary remarks as to his usefulness.  The\ngolden coin lay in his pocket.  It was the first he had ever earned.  He\nhad intended to go straight home and lay the shining piece in his\nmother's lap, for Willie was a peculiar boy, and had some strange\nnotions in regard to the destination of \"first-fruits.\"  Where he had\ngot them nobody could tell.  Perhaps his mother knew, but nobody ever\nquestioned her upon the point.\n\nTaking this gold piece from his pocket, he ran into the nearest\nrespectable street, and selected there the most respectable grocer's\nshop, into which he entered, and demanded a pound of the shopman's best\ntea, a pound of his best sugar, a pound of his best butter, a cut of his\nbest bacon, and one of his best wax-candles.  Willie knew nothing about\nrelative proportion in regard to such things; he only knew that they\nwere usually bought and consumed together.\n\nThe shopman looked at the little purchaser in surprise, but as Willie\nemphatically repeated his demands he gave him the required articles.  On\nreceiving the sovereign he looked twice at Willie, rung the piece of\nmoney three times on the counter, and then returned the change.\n\nGathering the packages in his arms, and putting the candle between his\nvest and bosom, he went into a baker's shop, purchased a loaf, and\nreturned to the \"subterraneous grotto\" laden like the bee.  To say that\nthe fairy was surprised when he displayed these things, would be a\nfeeble use of language.  She opened her large eyes until Willie begged\nher in alarm not to open them wider for fear they should come out, at\nwhich sally she laughed, and then, being weak, she cried.\n\nAfter that she fell in with her nurse's humour, and the two proceeded to\n\"have a night of it.\"  Ziza said she'd be a real fairy and tell him what\nto do, and Willie said he'd be a gnome or a he-fairy and do it.\n\nAt the outset Willie discovered that he had forgotten coals, but this\nwas rectified by another five minutes' airing, and a rousing fire was\nquickly roaring in the chimney, while the kettle sang and spluttered on\nit like a sympathetic thing, as no doubt it was.  Willie cleared the\nsmall table that stood at the invalid's bed side, and arranged upon it\nthe loaf, the tea-pot, two cracked tea-cups, the butter and sugar, and\nthe wax-candle--which latter was stuck into a quart bottle in default of\na better candle-stick.\n\n\"Now, ain't that jolly?\" said the nurse, sitting down and rubbing his\nhands.\n\n\"Very!\" replied the patient, her eyes sparkling with delight.\n\n\"It's so like a scene in a play,\" continued Willie.\n\n\"Only much more real,\" suggested the fairy.\n\n\"Now, then, Ziza, have a cup o' tea, fresh from the market o' Chiny, as\nyour dad would say, if he was sellin' it by auction.  He's a knowin'\ncodger your dad is, Ziza.  There.  I knowed I forgot somethin' else--the\ncream!\"\n\n\"I don't mind it, indeed I don't,\" said Ziza earnestly.\n\nWillie had started up to run out and rectify this omission, but on being\nassured that the fairy liked tea almost as well without as with cream,\nand that there was no cream to be got near at hand, he sat down again\nand continued to do the honours of the table.  First he made the fairy\nsit up in bed, and commented sadly on her poor thin neck as she did it,\nobserving that she was nothing better than a skeleton in a skin.  Then\nhe took off his own jacket and put it on her shoulders, tying the arms\nround her neck.  Next he placed a piece of board in front of her, saying\nthat it was a capital tray, and on this he arranged the viands neatly.\n\n\"Now, then, go at it, Ziza,\" he said, when all was arranged.\n\nZiza, who received his attentions with looks that were wonderfully\ngleeful for one in her weak state of health, went at it with such vigour\nthat the bread was eaten and the tea drunk in a few minutes, and the\nsupply had to be renewed.  When she was in the middle of her second\nround of buttered toast (for Willie had toasted the bread), she stopped\nsuddenly.\n\n\"Why don't you go on?\" asked Willie.\n\n\"Because you have not eaten or drunk one mouthful yet.\"\n\n\"But I'm lookin' at you, and ain't that better?  Howsever, if ye won't\ngo on, I'll not keep you back,\" and with that Willie set to work, and,\nbeing uncommonly hungry, did what he styled \"terrible execution among\nthe wittles.\"\n\nFor some time the nurse and patient ate in comparative silence, but by\ndegrees they began to talk, and as they became more confidential their\ntalk became more personal.\n\n\"D'you like bein' a fairy?\" said Willie, after a lull in the\nconversation.\n\n\"No, I don't,\" replied Ziza.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because--because--I don't like the kind of things we have to do, and--\nand--in short, I don't like it at all, and I often pray God to deliver\nme from it.\"\n\n\"That's strange, now,\" said Willie, \"I would have thought it great fun\nto be a fairy.  I'd rather be a little clown or a he-fairy myself, now,\nthan anything else I know of, except a fireman.\"\n\n\"A fireman, Willie?\"\n\n\"Yes, a fireman.  My brother, Blaz--a--Frank, I mean, is one, and he\nsaved the lives of some people not long since.\"\n\nOf course Willie here diverged into a graphic account of the fire in\nBeverly Square, and, seeing that Ziza listened with intense earnestness,\nhe dilated upon every point, and went with special minuteness into the\ndoings of Frank.\n\nWhen he concluded, Ziza heaved a very deep sigh and closed her eyes.\n\n\"I've tired you, Ziza,\" exclaimed Willie, jumping up, with a look of\nanxiety, and removing the tea-board and jacket, as the child slipped\ndown under the clothes.  He asked if she wanted to go to sleep.\n\n\"Yes, for I'm _very_ tired,\" she sighed languidly; then added, \"but\nplease read to me a little first.\"\n\n\"What book am I to read you?\" said Willie, looking round the room, where\nno book of any kind was to be seen.\n\n\"Here, it's under the pillow.\"\n\nWillie put his hand under the pillow and pulled out a small\npocket-Bible.\n\n\"Read the third chapter of Saint John's Gospel,\" said the child, closing\nher eyes.\n\nWillie read in the monotonous tones of a schoolboy's voice until he came\nto the sixteenth verse, \"For God so loved the world, that He gave His\nonly begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish,\nbut have everlasting life.\"\n\n\"Stop at _that_ verse,\" whispered Ziza.  \"I'll go to sleep now.\"\n\nHer deep breathing soon proclaimed that she was in the land of dreams,\nso Willie removed the candle a little further away from her, and then,\nresting his elbows on the table and his head in his hands, began to read\nthe Bible.  He turned over a few pages without much intention of finding\nany particular place, for he was beginning to feel sleepy.\n\nThe first words his eyes fell upon were, \"Blessed are they that consider\nthe poor.\"\n\nHe roused up a little at this, and read the verse again, for he\nconnected it with the fact that the fairy was poor.  Then he pondered it\nfor some time, and, falling asleep, dropt his head on the Bible with\nsuch force that he woke up for a little and tried to read again, but do\nwhat he would he could not get beyond that verse; finally he gave up the\nattempt, and, laying his forehead down upon it, quickly fell sound\nasleep.\n\nIn this state the couple were discovered an hour or two later by Messrs.\nCattley senior and junior on their return from the theatre.\n\n\"Inscrutable mysteries! say, what is this?\" exclaimed the elder clown,\nadvancing into the room on tiptoe.\n\nApostrophising his eye and one Betty Martin, the younger clown said that\nit was a \"rare go and no mistake,\" whereupon his father laid his hand on\nWillie's shoulder and gently shook him.\n\n\"Eh! another cup, Ziza?\" exclaimed the self-accused nurse, as he put out\nhis hand to seize the tea-pot.  \"Hallo!  I thought it was the fairy,\" he\nadded, looking up with a sleepy smile; \"I do believe I've gone and fell\nasleep.\"\n\n\"Why, lad, where got ye all those things?\" inquired the senior Cattley,\nlaying aside his cloak and cap, and speaking in a low tone, for Ziza was\nstill sleeping soundly.\n\n\"Well, I got 'em,\" replied Willie in a meditative tone, \"from a friend\nof mine--a very partikler friend o' mine--as declines to let me mention\nhis name, so you'll have to be satisfied with the wittles and without\nthe name of the wirtuous giver.  P'r'aps it was a dook, or a squire, or\na archbishop as did it.  Anyway his name warn't Walker.  See now, you've\nbin an' woke up the fairy.\"\n\nThe sick child moved as he spoke, but it was only to turn, without\nawaking, on her side.\n\n\"Well, lad,\" said the clown, sitting down and looking wistfully in the\nface of his daughter, \"you've got your own reasons for not tellin' me--\nmayhap I've a pretty good guess--anyhow I say God bless him, for I do\nb'lieve he's saved the child's life.  I've not seen her sleep like that\nfor weeks.  Look at her, Jim; ain't she like her old self?\"\n\n\"Yes, father, she don't need no paint and flour to make a fairy on her\njust now.  She's just like what she was the last time I seed her go up\nin a gauze cloud to heaven, with red and blue fire blazin' all round\nher.\"\n\n\"I'll bid ye good-night now,\" said Willie, buttoning up his jacket to\nthe chin, and pulling his cap down on his brows with the air of a man\nwho has a long walk before him.\n\n\"You're off, are you--eh?\" said the elder clown, rising and taking\nWillie by the hand, \"well, you're a good lad.  Thank'ee for comin' here\nan' takin' care of Ziza.  My subterranean grotto ain't much to boast of,\nbut such as it is you're welcome to it at all times.  Good-night.\"\n\n\"Good-night,\" said Willie; \"good-night, Jim.\"  Jim replied good-night\nheartily, and then Willie stepped into the dark passage.  He glanced\nback at the fairy before shutting the door, but her eyes were closed, so\nhe said good-night to her in his heart, and went home.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\n\nHOME LIFE.\n\n\"My dear Miss Tippet, I shall never, no never, get over it.\"\n\nSo said, and so undoubtedly thought, a thin little old lady with\nremarkably bright eyes, and a sweet old face, as she sat sipping tea at\nMiss Tippet's elbow.\n\nIt was in the drawing-room of Miss Deemas that she sat, and the Eagle\nsat opposite to her.\n\n\"It was very dreadful,\" responded Miss Tippet with a sigh--\"very.\"\n\n\"It was awful.  I know I shall never get over it,--never,\" repeated the\nlittle old lady, finishing her tea, and asking for another cup in the\ncalmest possible voice, with the sweetest possible smile.\n\n\"Oh yes, you will, Mrs Denman,\" said Miss Deemas snappishly.\n\n\"No, indeed, I won't,\" repeated Mrs Denman; \"how can I?  Just think of\nthe situation.  Sitting in my chair in dishabille, when a man--a Man,\nMiss Dee--\"\n\n\"Well, I know what a _man_ is,\" said the Eagle bitterly; \"why don't you\ngo on?\"\n\n\"Burst himself through my bedroom-door,\" continued Mrs Denman, \"with\nlime and charcoal and brick-dust and water streaming down his face--\nf-fo-olded me in his arms, bore me out into the street--the _street_!\nOh!  I shall never, _never_ get over it; and so little, so _very_ little\nclothing on me--\"\n\n\"How much had you on?\" asked Miss Deemas in a deep voice, the calmness\nof which contrasted forcibly with Mrs Denman's excited tones.\n\n\"Really, Miss Deemas, I see no necessity for going into particulars.  It\nis sufficient to know that I was carried by a _man_ into the _street_ in\nthe face of some thousands of people, for I heard them cheering though I\nsaw them not.  I know I shall never get over it--another cup, my love;\nnot _quite_ so much sugar--no, not if I were to live to the age of\nMethusaleh.\"\n\n\"I don't wonder, indeed I don't,\" murmured the sympathetic Miss Tippet.\n\"I think, Julia dear, you are a little too hard on Mrs Denman.  How\nwould _you_ like to have been carried out of a burning house in such a\nway by a big rough man?\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear,\" interposed Mrs Denman, \"I did not say he was rough.  Big\nhe certainly was, and strong, but I must do him the justice to say that\nthe man li--lif--oh me! lifted me up very tenderly, and carried me as\nthough I had been an infant and he my mother, through smoke and fire and\nwater, into the street, before the eyes of the--whole--oh, it's too\nawful to think of!\"\n\n\"Stuff!\" ejaculated Miss Deemas, pecking a piece of cake out of her\nfingers as she would, metaphorically of course, have pecked the eyes out\nof the head of Frank Willders, or any other man.  \"Didn't you say he put\na blanket round you?\"\n\n\"Of course, Miss Deemas; I should have died otherwise of pure shame.\"\n\n\"No, you wouldn't,\" retorted the Eagle.  \"You would probably have been\nhalf suffocated and a good deal dirtied, and you might have been singed,\nbut you wouldn't have died; and what need you care now, for the people\nsaw nothing but a bundle.  You might have been a bundle of old clothes\nfor all they knew or cared.  All they wanted to see was the bravery, as\nthey call it, of the man; as if there were not hundreds upon hundreds of\nwomen who would do the same thing if their muscles were strong enough,\nand occasion served.\"\n\n\"But it _was_ a brave act, you know,\" said Miss Tippet timidly.\n\n\"I don't know that,\" retorted Miss Deemas, helping herself to more cake\nwith as much decision of manner as if she had been carrying it off by\nforce of arms from before the very muzzles of a masculine battery.  \"I\ndon't know that.  He had to escape, you know, for his own life, and he\nmight as well bring a bundle along with him as not.\"\n\n\"Yes; but then,\" said Miss Tippet, \"he first went up the--the thingumy,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"No, he didn't,\" retorted Miss Deemas smartly; \"he was in the house at\nthe time, and only came down the \\`thingumy,' as you call it!\"\n\nIt was a peculiarity of Miss Deemas's character, that she claimed the\nright to be as rude as she chose to people in her own house, and rather\nprided herself on this evidence of independence.\n\n\"In my opinion,\" said Mrs Denman, \"his being in the burning house at\nall of his own accord, was of itself evidence of courage.  I think the\nfireman is a brave young man.\"\n\nThus much Mrs Denman said with dignity to Miss Deemas.  The remainder\nof her speech she addressed to Miss Tippet.\n\n\"But, my dear, I feel that although I owe this young man a debt of\ngratitude which I can never repay, I shall never be able to look my\npreserver in the face.  I _know_ that his mind will always revert, when\nhe sees me, to the fi--fig--the figure that he lifted out of that\neasy-chair.  But there is one thing I have resolved on,\" continued the\nlittle old lady in more cheerful tones, as she asked for another cup of\ntea, \"and that is, to get a fireman to instruct me as to the best method\nof saving my own life should fire again break out in my dwelling.\"\n\nThe Eagle gave a hysterical chuckle at this.\n\n\"I have already written to one who has been recommended to me as a\nshrewd man, and he is coming to call on me this very evening at seven\no'clock.\"\n\nMrs Denman started, as if her own remark had recalled something, and\npulled out her watch.\n\n\"Why, it is almost half-past six!\" she exclaimed, rising hastily.\n\"Excuse a hurried departure, Miss Deemas.  Your society and sympathy\"\n(she looked pointedly at Miss Tippet here) \"have been so agreeable that\nI did not observe how time was flying.  Good-bye, Miss Deemas.  Good\nevening, _dear_ Miss Tippet.\"\n\nMiss Deemas bowed.\n\n\"Good-bye, my love,\" said Miss Tippet, bustling round her friend.  \"I'm\n_so_ glad to have met you, and I hope you'll come and see me soon; 6\nPoor-thing Lane, remember.  Come whenever you please, dear Mrs Denman.\nYes, yes, time does indeed fly, as you say; or as my friend, Sir\nArchibald What's-his-name used to remark, \\`Tempit fugus something\nre-what's-'is-name.'  _Good-bye_, dear Mrs Denman.\"\n\nWhile the ladies were thus engaged, one whom the Eagle would have tossed\nher beak at with supreme contempt was enjoying himself in the bosom of\nhis family.  This was none other than Joe Corney himself, who, having\nreceived a \"stop\" for a distant fire, had looked in on his wife to tell\nher of the note he had received from Mrs Denman.\n\nThe family bosom resided in a small portion of a small house in the\nsmall street where the fire-engine dwelt.\n\nJoe had laid his helmet on the table, and, having flung himself into a\nchair, seized his youngest child, a little girl, in his arms, raised her\nhigh above his head and laughed in her face; at which the child chuckled\nand crowed to the best of its ability.\n\nMeanwhile his eldest son, Joe junior, immediately donned the helmet,\nseized the poker, thrust the head of it into a bucket of water, and,\npointing the other end at a supposed fire, began to work an imaginary\nhand-pump with all his might.\n\n\"It's goin' out, daddy,\" cried the urchin.\n\n\"Sure, he's a true chip o' the owld block,\" observed his mother, who was\npreparing the evening meal of the family; \"he's uncommon fond o' fire\nan' wather.\"\n\n\"Molly, my dear,\" said the fireman, \"I'd have ye kape a sharp eye on\nthat same chip, else his fondness for fire may lead to more wather than\nye'd wish for.\"\n\n\"I've bin thinkin' that same meself, honey,\" replied Mrs Corney,\nplacing a pile of buttered toast on the table.  \"Shure didn't I kitch\nhim puttin' a match to the straw bed the other day!  Me only consolation\nis that ivery wan in the house knows how to use the hand-pump.  Ah,\nthen, ye won't believe it, Joe, but I catched the baby at it this\nmornin', no later, an' she'd have got it to work, I do believe, av she\nhadn't tumbled right over into the bucket, an' all but drownded herself.\nBut, you know, the station's not far off, if the house did git alight.\nShure ye might run the hose from the ingin to here without so much as\ndrawin' her out o' the shed.  Now, then, Joe, tay's ready, so fall to.\"\n\nJoe did fall to with the appetite of a man who knows what it is to toil\nhard, late and early.  Joe junior laid aside the helmet and poker, and\ndid his duty at the viands like the true son of a fireman--not to say an\nIrishman--and for five minutes or so the family enjoyed themselves in\nsilence.  After that Joe senior heaved a sigh, and said that it would be\nabout time for him to go and see the old lady.\n\n\"What can it be she wants?\" asked Mrs Corney.\n\n\"Don't know,\" replied her husband.  \"All I know is that she's the old\nlady as was bundled neck and crop out o' the first-floor windy o' the\nhouse in Holborn by Frank Willders.  She's a quare owld woman that.\nShe's got two houses, no less; wan over the coachmaker's shop--the shop\nbein' her property--an' wan in Russell Square.  They say she's rich\nenough to line her coffin with goold an inch thick.  Spakin' o' that,\nMolly my dear, a quare thing happened to me the other night.  It's what\nye call a coinsidence.\"\n\n\"What's that, Joe?\"\n\n\"Well, t'ain't easy to explain, but it means two things happenin'\ntogether in a most onlikely way--d'ye see?\"\n\n\"No, I don't, Joe,\" replied Mrs Corney, helping herself to another\nslice of toast.\n\n\"Well, it don't matter much,\" resumed Joe, \"but this is what it was: Mr\nDale an' me was sittin', about two in the mornin', at the station fire\nsmokin' our pipes (for it was my turn on duty) an' chattin' away about\none thing an' another, when somehow we got upon tellin' our experiences,\nan' Dale he tells me a story o' how he was once called to a fire in a\ncemetary, an' had to go down among the coffins--for they was afire--an'\nwhat a fright some o' his men got, when, just as he had finished, an'\nall my flesh was creepin' at wot I'd heard, there comes a ring at the\nbell an' a call to a fire in Portland Street.  I runs an' gets out the\ningin, an' Frank (he was my mate that night) he rings up the boys, an'\naway we wint in tin minutes.  It wasn't far, an' when we got there in we\nwint into the house, which was full o' smoke, but no fire to be seen.\nWe wint coughin' and sneezin' an' rubbin' our eyes down into a cellar,\nwhere the lads of another ingin was at work before us wi' the\nhand-pumps, an', would ye belaive it? but the walls o' that cellar was\nlined wi' coffins!  True for ye, there they was, all sizes, as thick as\nthey could stand.  I thought I was dramin', but it was no drame, for it\nwas an undertaker's shop; an' when I wint upstairs, after we diskivered\nthe fire an' put it out, I sees two coffins on tressels lyin' ready for\nuse.  Wan was black-painted wood, no doubt for a poor man, an' nothin'\ninside o't.  The other alongside was covered wid superfine black cloth\nan' silver-mounted handles, an' name-plate, an' it was all padded inside\nan' lined wid white satin!\"\n\n\"White satin, Joe?  You're jokin'.\"\n\n\"As sure as your name's Molly, it was white satin,\" repeated Joe; \"I\nwouldn't have belaived it av I hadn't seen it; but that's the way the\nquality goes to their graves.  I looks at the two coffins as I was\ncomin' away, an' thinks I to myself, I wonder whether the poor man or\nthe rich man'll be most comfortable when they're laid there?\"\n\n\"Now, Molly, I'll bid ye good-night an' be off to see this owld lady,\nthis Mrs Denman.  Look afther that boy, now, an kape the matches out of\nhis way, whativer ye do.\"\n\nWith this very needful warning, Joe Corney kissed his wife and the baby,\nand went off to the station to obtain leave of absence for a couple of\nhours.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\n\nJOE CORNEY'S ADVICE.\n\nWending his way through the crowded streets, Joe soon reached the door\nof the house in Russell Square which belonged to Mrs Denman.\n\nThe good lady had made use of a cab after quitting Miss Deemas, so that\nshe was at home and seated in a luxuriously easy chair in her splendidly\nfurnished drawing-room when the fireman applied the knocker.\n\n\"Does Mrs Denman stop here, my dear?\" said Joe to the smart\nservant-girl who opened the door.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the girl, \"and she told me to show you up to the\ndrawing-room whenever you came.  Step this way.\"\n\nJoe pulled off his cap and followed the maid, who ushered him into the\npresence of the little old lady.\n\n\"Pray take a chair,\" said Mrs Denman, pointing to one which had\nevidently been placed close to hers on purpose.  \"You are a fireman, I\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" replied Joe, \"I've bin more nor tin years at the business\nnow.\"\n\n\"You must find it a very warm business, I should imagine,\" said Mrs\nDenman, with a smile.\n\n\"True for ye, ma'am.  My body's bin a'most burnt off my sowl over and\nover again; but it's cowld enough, too, sometimes, specially when ye've\ngot to watch the premises after the fire's bin put out of a cowld winter\nnight, as I had to do at _your_ house, ma'am.\"\n\nMrs Denman started and turned pale.\n\n\"What! d'you mean to say that you were at the fire in--in Holborn that\nnight?\"\n\n\"Indeed I do, ma'am.  Och! but ye must be ill, ma'am, for yer face is as\nwhite as a ghost.  Shure but it's _red_ now.  Let me shout for some\nwather for ye, ma'am.\"\n\n\"No, no, my good man,\" said Mrs Denman, recovering herself a little.\n\"I--I--the fact is, it did not occur to me that you had been at _that_\nfire, else I would never--but no matter.  You didn't see--see--any one\nsaved, did you?\"\n\n\"See any one saved, is it?  Shure, I did, an' yerself among the lot.\nOch! but it's Frank Willders as knows how to do a thing nately.  He\nbrought ye out o' the windy, ma'am, on his showlder as handy as if ye'd\nbin a carpet-bag, or a porkmanty, ma'am--\"\n\n\"Hush, _man_!\" exclaimed poor Mrs Denman, blushing scarlet, for she was\na very sensitive old lady; \"I cannot bear to think of it.  But how\ncould--you know it was me?  _It--it--might_ have been anything--a\nbundle, you know.\"\n\n\"Not by no manes,\" replied the candid Joe.  \"We seed your shape quite\nplain, ma'am, for the blankit was tight round ye.\"\n\nMrs Denman covered her face with her hand at this point, and resting\nher elbow on the arm of her chair, reflected that the thing was beyond\nremedy, and that, as the man had come and was now looking at her,\nmatters could not be worse; so she resolved to carry out her original\nintention, and question him as to the best course of action in the event\nof fire.\n\n\"My good man,\" she said, \"I have taken the liberty of asking you to come\nhere to tell me what I should do to guard against fire in future.\"\n\nJoe rubbed his nose and looked at the ground; then he stroked his chin\nand looked at the old lady; then a look of intelligence lighted up his\nexpressive countenance as he said abruptly--\n\n\"Is yer house an' furniture insured, ma'am?\"\n\n\"No, it is not,\" replied Mrs Denman.  \"I have never insured in my life,\nbecause although I hear of fires every day in London, it has never\noccurred to me until lately that there was any probability of _my_ house\nbeing burned.  I know it was very foolish of me, but I shall see to\nhaving it done directly.\"\n\n\"That's right, ma'am,\" said Joe, with an approving nod.  \"If you seed\nthe heaps an' heaps o' splendid furnitur' an' goods an' buildin's as is\nburnt every day a'most in London, an' lost to the owners 'cause they\ngrudged the few shillin's of insurance, or 'cause they was careless an'\ndidn't b'lieve a fire would ever come to them, no matter how many might\ncome to other folk, you'd insure yer house an' furnitur' first thing i'\nthe mornin', ma'am.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt you say what is quite correct, Mr Corney, and I will\ncertainly attend to this matter in future; but I am more particularly\nanxious to know how I should act if the house in which I live were to\ntake fire.\"\n\n\"Get out of it as fast as possible,\" said Joe promptly, \"an' screech out\n_fire_! till yer sides is sore.\"\n\n\"But suppose,\" said Mrs Denman, with a faint smile, \"that the fire is\nburning in the stair, and the house full of smoke, what am I to do?\"\n\n\"Och!  I see yer drift now, ma'am,\" said Joe, with a knowing look.  \"Av\nit's that what ye wants to know, I'll just, with your lave, ma'am, give\nye a small discourse on the subjic'.\"\n\nJoe cleared his throat, and began with the air of a man who knows what\nhe is talking about.\n\n\"It's as well, ma'am, to begin by tryin' to prevent yer house ketchin'\nfire--prevention bein' better nor cure.  If ye'd kape clear o' that,\nthere's two or three small matters to remimber.  First of all, take\noncommon good care o' your matches, an' don't let the childer git at\n'em, if you've any in the house.  Would you believe it, ma'am, there was\nabove fifty fires in London last year that was known to ha' bin set\nalight by childers playin' wid matches, or by careless servants lettin'\n'em drop an' treadin' on 'em?\"\n\n\"How many?\" asked Mrs Denman in surprise.\n\n\"Fifty, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Dear me! you amaze me, fireman; I had supposed there were not so many\nfires in London in a year.\"\n\n\"A year!\" exclaimed Joe.  \"Why, there's nearly three fires, on the\naverage, every twinty-four hours in London, an' that's about a thousand\nfires in the year, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Are you sure of what you say, fireman?\"\n\n\"Quite sure, ma'am; ye can ax Mr Braidwood if ye don't b'lieve me.\"\n\nMrs Denman, still in a state of blank amazement, said that she did not\ndoubt him, and bade him go on.\n\n\"Well, then,\" resumed Joe, \"look well arter yer matches, an' niver read\nin bed; that's the way hundreds o' houses get a light.  When you light a\ncandle with a bit o' paper, ma'am, don't throw it on the floor an' tramp\non it an' think it's out, for many a time there's a small spark left,\nan' the wind as always blows along the floor sets it up an' it kitches\nsomethin', and there you are--blazes an' hollerin' an' ingins goin' full\nswing in no time.  Then, ma'am, never go for to blow out yer gas, an' if\nthere's an escape don't rest till ye get a gasfitter and find it out.\nBut more particularly don't try to find it yerself with a candle.  Och!\nif ye'd only seen the blows up as I've seen from gas, ye'd look better\narter it.  Not more nor two weeks gone by, ma'am, we was called to\nattend a fire which was caused by an escape o' gas.  W'en we got there\nthe fire was out, but sitch a mess you niver did see.  It was a house,\nma'am, in the West End, with the most illigant painted walls and\ncornices and gimcracks, idged all with goold.  The family had just got\ninto it--noo done up for 'em, only, by good luck, there wasn't much o'\nthe furnitur' in.  They had smelled a horrid smell o' gas for a good\nwhile, but couldn't find it.  At last the missis, she goes with a\nworkman an a _candle_ to look for it, an' sure enough they found it in a\nbathroom.  It had been escapin' in a small closet at the end o' the\nbath, and not bein' able to git out, for the door was a tight fit, it\nhad gone away an' filled all the space between the ceilin's an' floors,\nan' between the lath, and plaster, and the walls.  The moment the door\nin the bath-room was opened all this gas took light an' blowed up like\ngunpowder.  The whole inner skin o' the beautiful drawing-room, ma'am,\nwas blowed into the middle of the room.  The cook, who was in the\ndrawin'-room passage, she was blow'd down stairs; the workman as opened\nthe little door, he was blow'd flat on his back; an' the missis, as was\nstandin' with her back to a door, she was lifted off her legs and blow'd\nright through the doorway into a bedroom.\"\n\n\"Gracious!\" exclaimed the horrified Mrs Denman, \"was she killed?\"\n\n\"No, ma'am, she warn't killed.  Be good luck they was only stunned an'\ndreadful skeared, but no bones was broken.\"\n\nMrs Denman found relief in a sigh.\n\n\"Well, ma'am,\" continued Joe, \"let me advise you to sweep yer chimleys\nonce a month.  When your chimley gets afire the sparks they get out, and\nwhen sparks get out of a windy night there's no tellin' what they won't\nlight up.  It's my opinion, ma'am, that them as makes the laws should\nmore nor double the fines for chimleys goin' afire.  But suppose, ma'am,\nyour house gets alight in spite of you--well then, the question is\nwhat's best to do?\"\n\nMrs Denman nodded her old head six or seven times, as though to say,\n\"That is precisely the question.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you, ma'am,\"--here Joe held up the fore-finger of his right\nhand impressively.  \"In the first place, every one in a house ought to\nknow all the outs and ins of it, 'cause if you've got to look for things\nfor the first time when the cry of \\`Fire' is raised, it's not likely\nthat you'll find 'em.  Now, d'ye know, or do the servants know, or does\nanybody in the house know, where the trap in the roof is?\"\n\nMrs Denman appeared to meditate for a minute, and then said that she\nwas not sure.  She herself did not know, and she thought the servants\nmight be ignorant on the point, but she rather thought there was an old\none in the pantry, but they had long kept a cat, and so didn't require\nit.\n\n\"Och!\" exclaimed Joe, with a broad grin, \"sure it's a trap-door I'm\nspakin' of.\"\n\nMrs Denman professed utter ignorance on this point, and when told that\nit ought to be known to every one in the house as a mode of escape in\nthe event of fire, she mildly requested to know what she would have to\ndo if there were such a trap.\n\n\"Why, get out on the roof to be sure,\" (Mrs Denman shivered) \"and get\nalong the tiles to the next house,\" (Mrs Denman shut her eyes and\nshuddered) \"an' so make yer escape.  Then you should have a ladder fixed\nto this trap-door so as it couldn't be took away, and ye should have\nsome dozen fathoms o' half-inch rope always handy, cause if ye was cut\noff from the staircase by fire an' from the roof by smoke ye might have\nto let yourself down from a windy.  It's as well, too, to know how to\nknot sheets and blankets together, so that the ties won't slip, for if\nyou have no rope they'd be better than nothin'.  You should also have a\nhand-pump, ma'am, and a bucket of water always handy, 'cause if you take\na fire at the beginnin' it's easy put out.  An' it's as well to know\nthat you should go into a room on fire on your hands and knees, with\nyour nose close to the ground--just as a pinter-dog goes--'cause there's\nmore air there than overhead; an' it's better to go in wi' the hand-pump\nthe first thing.  Don't wait to dress, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Stop, stop, Mr Corney!\" cried Mrs Denman, holding up her hand.\n\nThe little lady was stunned with the rapid utterance of the enthusiastic\nfireman, and with the dreadful suggestion that she, Mrs Denman, should,\nin the dead of night, get upon the roof of her dwelling and scramble\nover the tiles, or let herself down by a rope from a window into the\npublic street, or creep into a burning room on her hands and knees with\nher nose to the ground like a pointer, and all this, too, in her\nnight-dress, so she begged of him to stop, and said:\n\n\"But you forget, fireman, it is impossible for _me_ to do any of these\ndreadful things.\"\n\n\"Well, ma'am,\" returned Joe coolly, \"it wouldn't be easy--though, for\nthe matter o' that, it's wonderful what people will do for their lives;\nbut I was tellin' ye, ma'am, what ought to be done, so as somebody else\nin the house might do it, if you couldn't.\n\n\"But suppose, ma'am,\" continued Joe, without waiting for a reply;\n\"suppose that the house is alight.  Well, the first thing you've got to\ndo, is not to get into a fluster.  That can't do no good, you know, and\nis sure to do mischief.  Keep cool.  That's the first thing, ma'am; and\nbe deliberate in all ye do.  The second thing is, to wrap a blanket\nround ye, an' get out of the house as fast as ye can without stoppin' to\ndress.  It's of no use lookin' put out, ma'am; for it's better to escape\nwithout yer clo'es than to be burnt alive in 'em.  Then be careful to\n_shut all doors after ye_ as ye go.  This keeps the air from gittin' at\nthe fire, and so smothers it down till the ingines come up.  Also keep\nall windows shut.  If the smoke is like to choke ye, git yer nose as\nnear the ground as possible, an' go along on yer hands and knees.  A bit\no' flannel or a worsted sock held over yer mouth an' nose, will help you\nto bear it better.\n\n\"If ye can't escape by the street-door, or the trap in the roof, then\nget into a front room, where you will be more easy to be got at wid\nladders or fire-escapes, an' see that _every mimber o' the household_ is\nthere.  Many a wan has bin forgotten in the hurry-skurry of a fire, and\nleft asleep in bed, ignorant o' the danger till too late; when a cool\nhead might have missed 'em, and wakened 'em in time.  Whatever ye do,\nma'am--keep cool.\"\n\nThe probability of poor Mrs Denman keeping cool in such circumstances\nwas uncommonly small; for she was at that moment hot all over, and her\nface flushed at the mere recital of such horrors!\n\nJoe then went on to state, that the very last thing she should do was to\njump from a window (a somewhat unnecessary piece of advice, poor Miss\nDenman thought), and that, when she was compelled to take such a step,\nshe should first of all pitch over all the blankets and bedding she\ncould lay hold of to make her fall easy.  He wound up with an emphatic\nreiteration of the assurance that her only chance lay in \"keeping cool.\"\n\nThat night, poor Mrs Denman, in a condition of mind that is utterly\nindescribable, because inconceivable, went through the whole of the\ndreadful processes which Joe had described; and did it, too, with\nmiraculous presence of mind and energy--in her dreams.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINETEEN.\n\nDARK PLOTS ARE HATCHED.\n\nGorman was one of those peculiar characters who, in personal appearance,\nare totally devoid of peculiarity.  He was a middle-sized, thick-set,\ncommonplace, grave, quiet man; very powerful--but not apparently so; one\nwhom it was impossible to \"find out\" unless he chose to let himself be\nfound out.  Above all, he was a reserved man.\n\nEverybody knew well enough, at least among his intimates, that he was\nnamed Gorman; but not one of the number knew what his Christian name\nwas.  A few were aware that he signed himself \"D.  Gorman\"; but whether\nthe \"D\" represented David, dastard, drunkard, or demon, was a matter of\npure speculation to all, a few of his female acquaintance excepted (for\nhe had no friends), who asserted roundly that it represented them all,\nand some were even willing to go the length of saying that it\nrepresented more, and stood for dirty, drivelling, desperate, and a few\nother choice words which it is quite unnecessary to mention.  Only a\nfew, and these were among the knowing and peculiarly observant ones of\nGorman's intimates, said that \"D\" stood for \"deep.\"  But then, many of\nthose who thus pronounced their opinion, were comparatively worthless\ncharacters, given to scandal and slander; so the reader must not allow\nhimself to be biassed too much by their report.\n\nCertain it is, however, that when Gorman was asked on one occasion what\nhis Christian name was, he replied that he had no Christian name;\nbecause he didn't believe in Christianity, and that he signed himself\n\"D,\" to be distinguished from the other Gormans who might chance to\nexist in the universe.\n\nPeople were not at all shocked at his bold statement of unbelief;\nbecause, in the circle in which he moved, the same disbelief was pretty\ngeneral.\n\nBesides many other traits and qualities, definable and indefinable,\nGorman had the power of assuming the appearance either of a burglar of\nthe lowest type, or a well-to-do contractor or tradesman.  A slight\nchange in dress and manner were sufficient to metamorphose him beyond\nrecognition.\n\nEverybody knew, also, that Gorman was the landlord of a small\npublic-house at the corner of a dirty street, not far from London\nBridge; and that he kept a stout, middle-aged man on the premises to do\nthe duty of host, while he himself went about \"other business,\" which\nnobody knew of, and which no one could find out, although many had tried\nto do so with all their might.\n\nEvery day in the year, Gorman might have been seen at the \"Golden Swan\";\nbut never for longer than a few minutes at a time, when he inspected the\nbooks, received the cash drawn the day before; and made an impression on\nall in the premises, that tended to convince them they were well looked\nafter.\n\n\"Humph!\" ejaculated Gorman, as he finished counting the dirty coppers\nand pieces of silver which his agent had delivered to him, and dropped\nthem from his dirty fingers into a dirty leather bag: \"Business is dull,\nI think.\"\n\n\"It ain't brisk just now, sir,\" replied the deputy-landlord of the\n\"Golden Swan.\"\n\nGorman received this reply with another \"Humph,\" and then, putting the\nbag in his coat pocket, prepared to leave.\n\n\"No one bin askin' for me?\" inquired Gorman.\n\n\"No, sir; no one.\"\n\n\"I'll be back to-morrow about this time.\"\n\nThe deputy knew that this was false, for his employer invariably came at\na different hour each day, in order to take \"the house\" by surprise; but\nhe said, \"Very well, sir,\" as usual.\n\n\"And mind,\" continued Gorman, \"that you put the lights out.  You're\nuncommon careful about that, I hope?\"\n\nIt is worthy of remark, in reference to Gorman's anxiety about putting\nout lights, that he had been burned out of several sets of premises in\nthe course of a few years.  He was quite a martyr, as it were, to fire.\nUnaccountably worried, pursued, and damaged by it--no, not damaged, by\nthe way; because Gorman was a prudent man, and always insured to the\nfull amount.  His enemies sometimes said _above_ it; but neither they\nnor we have any means of proving or disproving that.\n\nThe deputy protested that he always exercised the utmost precaution in\nputting everything out every night--from the last beery lingerer, to the\ngas--and that he felt quite put out himself at being asked the question,\nas it implied a doubt of his care and attention to business.  Hereupon\nGorman said \"Good-night,\" and the deputy returned to the counter, where\nbesotted men and drunken women awaited his attendance.\n\nThree-quarters of an hour sufficed to convey Gorman from the east to the\nwest end of London.  Here he sought the well-known precincts of\nPoorthing Lane, and entered the shop of Mr David Boone.\n\nThat worthy received him with a look of glad surprise; but with a\nfeeling of the deepest misery.\n\n\"Anyone inside?\" asked Gorman.\n\n\"No,\" said Boone, \"'cept the boy.  I'll call him to mind the shop, and\nthen we can be alone.\"\n\nAs Gorman did not vouchsafe a reply, but walked straight into the little\nroom behind the shop, Boone called the boy, and bade him mind the shop,\nwhile he held private consultation with his friend.\n\nThe shop-boy enjoyed the name of Robert Roddy.  He was a soft-faced,\nwashed-out youth, with a disposition to wink both eyes in a meek manner.\nRough-spoken people called him an idiot, but Roddy was not quite such\nan idiot as they took him for.  He obeyed his master's mandate by\nsitting down on a tall stool near the window, and occupied himself in\nattempting to carve a human face on the head of a walking-stick.\n\n\"Glad to see you, Mr Gorman,\" said Boone, seating his tall body on a\nlow stool at the side of his friend, who, with his hat on, had thrown\nhimself into an armchair, and spread out both legs before the fire.\n\"Very glad to see you, indeed, in my--little sanctum, my withdrawing\nroom, if I may venture to use the name, to which I retire during the\nintervals of business.\"\n\nBoone said this with an air of pleasantry, and smiled, but his visitor\ndid not encourage him.\n\n\"Pretty long intervals, I should suppose,\" he growled, pulling out his\npipe and lighting it.\n\nBoone admitted, with a sigh, that they were, and observed that trade was\nextremely dull--astonishingly dull.\n\n\"Why, would you believe it, sir, I have not sold twenty shillings' worth\no' goods all last week, and only one wax-doll within the month, although\nit's gettin' well on for Christmas-time?  One would a'most fancy the\nchildr'n was about to give up such vanities an' devote themselves to\nserious business.  It's a serious business for the like of us, anyhow.\"\n\nAgain Mr Boone smiled, and again failed to make an agreeable impression\non his visitor, who demanded in a surly tone if he had been thinking\nover it, and made up his mind to do it.\n\nBoone's face changed at this indefinite question, and became a shade\npaler than it was by nature, as he replied, hesitatingly, that he _had_\nbeen thinking over it, and that he had made up his mind _not_ to do it.\n\n\"Oh, you have, have you?\" said Gorman in a tone of irony.  \"Very good;\nthen I'll trouble you to pay me the three hundred pounds you owe me by\nthis day next week, and the rent of this here tenement for last half.\"\n\nBoone's face became still paler.\n\n\"You're a hard landlord,\" said he.\n\n\"You're a soft tenant,\" retorted Gorman.\n\n\"You know what the punishment is by law,\" continued Boone.\n\n\"Yes--death,\" said the other drily; \"but you know as well as I do that\nit's never carried out nowadays.\"\n\n\"But penal servitude for ten or twenty years ain't much better.\"\n\n\"Some men think it's worse,\" replied Gorman, with a savage grin; \"but\nyou've no need to fear.  If you only take the right precautions it's\nimpossible to find it out, an' I'll engage to put ye up to doin' it in\nsuch a way that there won't be a scrap the size of a sixpence left to\nconvict you.  Only put a bold face on it and the thing's done, and your\nfortune made as well as mine.\"\n\nThe man's voice and manner softened a little as he said this, for he\nthought he perceived symptoms of wavering in his tenant, who covered his\nface with his large thin hands and sighed deeply.\n\n\"Come, don't be hard on me,\" he said at length; \"I really haven't got\ncourage to go through with this.  Only give me a little more time, and\nI'll--\"\n\n\"Very good,\" interrupted Gorman, with an oath, as he rose and dashed his\npipe into fragments on the hearth; \"if you won't burn yourself out o'\nthis scrape.\"\n\n\"Hush! hush, man!\" said Boone in a hoarse whisper; \"not so loud; my lad\nwill hear you.  Come, I'll think of it.\"\n\n\"Will you _do_ it?\" demanded the other fiercely.  \"You know the\nalternative if you don't?\"\n\n\"Ruination?\"\n\n\"Exactly so; and that without delay.\"\n\n\"Ruination either way,\" murmured Boone sadly to himself, as though he\nwere counting the cost.\n\n\"Tut, man,\" said his landlord, becoming more gentle, \"it's nothing of\nthe sort.  If you only take my advice, it'll be a jolly blaze, which,\ninstead of ending in smoke will end in some thousands of pounds and\ncommencing business again on fresh capital.  Come, I've not got time to\nwaste with you.  There's no escape for you, so you'd better say yes,\nelse I'll go and have a talk with a legal friend of mine who is used to\nscrewing gold out of most unpromising mines.\"\n\nDavid Boone's face had by this time become so pale that it could not\nbecome paler, so it turned somewhat green instead.  His teeth, too, had\na tendency to chatter when he spoke, but by a strong mental effort he\nprevented this, and said in a subdued voice that he was willing to do\nwhatever his landlord pleased to command.\n\n\"That's all right,\" said Gorman, resuming his seat in front of the fire;\n\"now you speak like a man.  Sit down and I'll go over the matter with\nyou, and make your mind easy by showing you that it ain't either a\ndifficult or risky piece of work.  Bless you, it ain't the first time\nI've been up to that sort o' thing.\"\n\nIt did not require the diabolical leer that accompanied this remark to\nconvince his hearer of its truth.\n\n\"Now, then,\" said Gorman, with a business air, \"first of all, how stands\nthe stock in the shop?\"\n\n\"Rather low,\" answered Boone, who had reseated himself on the stool; \"in\nfact, I've got little or nothing more than what is visible.  I've bin so\nhard-up of late that I've had to crowd everything into view an' make the\nmost of appearances.  All the dressed dolls has got their frocks spread\nout, and the undressed ones their arms an' legs throwed about to make\n'em take up as much room as possible.  The lids of all the work boxes is\nopen, the slates and puzzle boxes stuck up in single rows, with their\nbroadsides to the front, and the collapsin' worlds is all inflated.\nEverything in the front is real, but all behind is sham dummies an'\nempty boxes.\"\n\nGorman opened his eyes a little on hearing this.\n\n\"Good,\" he said, after a pause; \"you're a cleverer fellow than I took\nyou for.  I thought you was well off, and I'm sure the neighbours think\nthe same, for the place looks pretty full an' thrivin'.  I suppose, now,\nif it was all sold off you wouldn't have enough to pay up my loans?\"\n\n\"Nothink like it,\" said Boone earnestly.  \"I've slaved night and day,\nan' done my best, but luck's again' me.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's 'cause you've bin faint-hearted in time past; you're goin'\nto be bold in time to come, my good fellow; you'll have to be bold, you\nwill.  Come, I'll explain how.  But first, let me ask how much you think\nthe stock is worth.\"\n\n\"Not much above fifty pounds.\"\n\n\"Hum! it looks like more.\"\n\n\"That's true, an' the people about think it's worth two or three\nhundred, for you see I have a lot o' cheap jewellery, and some of the\ninquisitive ones have been trying to pump me of late.  They all think\nI'm thriving,\" said Boone, shaking his head sorrowfully.\n\n\"So you are, so you are, man,\" said Gorman jocosely, \"and you're going\nto make your fortune soon, and so am I, though at present I'm poor\nenough.  However, that don't matter.  Here's your course for the future,\nwhich you're to steer by.  You'll go an' begin chatting with your\nneighbours at odd times, and your conversation, curiously enough, will\nalways be about the times bein' better than usual, an' about the\napproach of Christmas, an' the stock you mean to lay in against that\nfestive season.  After that you'll lay in the stock--fifty pounds'\nworth; and it won't be sham; it'll be real--\"\n\n\"But where is the money to come from?\" asked Boone.\n\n\"Oh, don't you trouble about the money; I'll provide that.  I've a\ncurious power of raisin' the wind on easy terms.  Fifty pounds' worth of\nreal goods will be bought by you, my thriving shopman, and you'll let\nsome of the neighbours, partiklerly these same inquisitive 'uns, see the\ngoods and some of the invoices, and you'll tell them that you've laid in\n150 pounds worth of stock, and that you think of layin' in more.  On the\nstrength of the press o' business you'll get another shop-lad, and\nyou'll keep 'em employed a good deal goin' messages, so that they won't\nget to know much about the state o' things, and I'll take care to send\nyou a rare lot o' customers, who'll come pretty often for small\npurchases, and give the shop an uncommon thrivin' look.  Oh, we'll make\na splendid appearance of doin' business, and we'll have lots of\nwitnesses ready to bother these sharp lawyers if need be--won't we,\nBoone?\"\n\nPoor Boone, whose colour had not yet improved much, smiled in a ghastly\nway, but said nothing.\n\n\"Well, then,\" resumed Gorman, after a few minutes' meditation, \"when\nthis thriving trade is in full swing we'll get it insured.  You know it\nwould never do to risk the loss of such valuable stock by fire--eh,\nBoone? common prudence pints that out!  You say what you have is worth\nfifty, and what you'll lay in is fifty more, makin' a hundred, so we'll\ninsure for five hundred; there's a clear gain of four hundred per cent,\nonly think of that!  Well, the house I have already insured for five\nhundred, that makes nine hundred, and we'll insure the furniture and\nfixings for fifty; that'll look business-like, you know.  Then the goods\nlaid in will be carefully removed in the night at various times before\nthe fire, so you had better see that they are small and portable\nobjects; that'll make another fifty pounds, if not more.  So I see my\nway to a thousand pounds.  That's a neat sum, ain't it, Boone?\"\n\nStill Boone made no reply, but favoured his visitor with another ghastly\nsmile.\n\n\"Well, then,\" pursued Gorman, \"all you've got to do is, on a certain\nnight that I will fix, to set the shop alight, and the thing's done\nquite easy.  But that's not all.  You've got an old mother, I believe;\nwell, it would be very unnatural in you to run the risk of being burned\nto death, an' leaving her penniless; so you'll insure your life for five\nhundred pounds, and I'll pay the first premium on it, and then you'll\ndie--\"\n\n\"Die!\" exclaimed Boone, with a start.\n\n\"Ay; why not, if you're to get a small fortune by it.\"\n\n\"But how's that to be managed?\" inquired Boone, with a look of doubt.\n\n\"Managed?  Nothing easier.  You'll be so desperately upset by the fire--\nperhaps singed a little too--that you'll be taken ill and won't get\nbetter.  I'll look carefully after you as your loving friend, and when\nyou're about dead you'll get up and clear off in a quiet way.  I'll make\narrangements to have a corpse as like you as possible put in your bed,\nand then you'll be buried comfortably, and we'll share the insurance.\nOf course you'll have to leave this part of the town and disguise\nyourself, but that won't be difficult.  Why, man, if you were only fond\nof a joke you might even attend your own funeral!  It's not the first\ntime that sort of thing has bin done.  So, then, you'll have your life\ninsured, but not yet.  Your first business is to set about the purchase\nof the stock, and, let me tell you, there's no time to lose, so I advise\nyou to write out the orders this very night.  I'll fetch you fifty\npounds in a day or two, and you'll pay up at once.  It'll look well, you\nknow, and after it's all settled we'll divide the plunder.  Now then,\ngood-night.  I congratulate you on your thriving business.\"\n\nGorman opened the door of the inner room as he said the last words, so\nthat the lad in the shop might hear them.  As he passed through the shop\nhe whispered in his friend's ear, \"Mind the consequences if you fail,\"\nand then left him with another hearty good-night.\n\nPoor David Boone, having sold himself to the tempter, went about his\nduties like an abject slave.  He began by ordering goods from various\nwholesale dealers in the city, after which he took occasion to stand a\ngood deal at his shop door and accost such of his neighbours as chanced\nto pass.  The conversation at such times invariably began with the\ninteresting topic of the weather, on which abstruse subject Boone and\nhis friends displayed a surprising profundity of knowledge, by stating\nnot only what the weather was at the time being, and what it had been in\ntime past, but what it was likely to be in time to come.  It soon\ndiverged, however, to business, and usually ended in a display of fresh\ngoods and invoices, and in references, on the part of Boone, to the\nfelicitous state of trade at the time.\n\nDo what he would, however, this thriving tradesman could not act his\npart well.  In the midst of his prosperity his smiles were ghastly and\nhis laughter was sardonic.  Even when commenting on the prosperity of\ntrade his sighs were frequent and deep.  One of his friends thought and\nsaid that prosperity was turning the poor man's brain.  Others thought\nthat he was becoming quite unnatural and unaccountable in his\ndeportment; and a few, acting on the principle of the sailor's parrot,\nwhich \"could not speak much, but was a tremendous thinker,\" gave no\noutward indication of their thoughts beyond wise looks and grave shakes\nof the head, by which most people understood them to signify that they\nfeared there was a screw loose somewhere.\n\nThis latter sentiment, it will be observed, is a very common one among\nthe unusually wise ones of the earth, and is conveniently safe, inasmuch\nas it is more or less true of every person, place, and thing in this sad\nworld of loose screws.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY.\n\nA LITTLE MORE HATCHING.\n\nOne night Edward Hooper, having consulted his watch frequently, and\ncompared it with the clock of slow notoriety in the warehouse in Tooley\nStreet, until his patience was almost gone, at last received the warning\nhiss, and had his books shut and put away before the minute-gun began to\nboom.  He was out at the door and half-way up the lane, with his hat a\ngood deal on one side of his head and very much over one eye, before the\nlast shot was fired.\n\n\"It's a jolly time of day this--the jolliest hour of the twenty-four,\"\nmuttered Ned to himself, with a smile.\n\nHis speech was thick, and his smile was rather idiotic, by reason of his\nhaving drunk more than his usual allowance at dinner that day.\n\nBy way of mending matters, Ned resolved to renew his potations\nimmediately, and announced his intentions to himself in the following\nwords:\n\n\"Com--mi--boy--y-you'll go--ave an--urrer por-o-porer--thash yer sort!\"\n\nAt a certain point in the drunkard's downward career he ceases to have\nany control over himself, and increases his speed from the usual\nstaggering jog-trot to a brisk zigzag gallop that generally terminates\nabruptly in the grave.\n\nNed Hooper, a kind-hearted fellow enough, and thinking himself not so\nbad as he seemed because of that same kind-heartedness, had reached the\ngalloping point, and was travelling unusually fast along the high road\nto ruin.\n\nBeing of a generous nature, Ned was in the habit of extending his\npatronage to various beer-shops, among others to that one near London\nBridge which has been described as the property of Gorman.  Business,\npleasure, or fancy led him to that shop on the evening in question.  He\nwas standing at the counter steadying himself with his left hand and\nholding a pewter-pot in his right, when the door of the inner room\nopened, and Gorman crossed the floor.  He was in a thoughtful mood, and\nwas about to pass out without raising his eyes, when Ned arrested him\nwith:\n\n\"Good ev-n'in', Misher Gorm'n.\"\n\nGorman glanced back, and then turned away as if in contempt, but,\nsuddenly checking himself, returned, and going up to Hooper with as\naffable a smile as his countenance would admit of, said that he was\ndelighted to shake hands with him, and that he was the very man he\nwanted to see, as he wished to have a word of conversation with him.\n\n\"Conv'shas'n wi' me?\" said Ned, swaying himself to and fro as he\nendeavoured to look steadily in the face of his friend; \"fire away,\nshen.  I'm sh' man f'r conv'shash'n, grave or gay, comic--'r--shublime,\n's all the shame to me!\"\n\nHe finished the pot, and laid it, with an immense assumption of care, on\nthe counter.\n\n\"Come out, we'll walk as we talk,\" said Gorman.\n\n\"Ha! to b'shure; 'at's poetical--very good, very good, we'll wa-alk as\nwe talk--ha! ha! very good.  Didn't know you wash a poet--eh? don't look\nlike 'un.\"\n\n\"Come along, then,\" said Gorman, taking him by the arm.\n\n\"Shtop!\" said Ned, drawing himself up with an air of drivelling dignity,\nand thrusting his hand into his trouser-pocket.\n\n\"What for?\" asked the other.\n\n\"I haven't p-paid for my b-beer.\"\n\n\"Never mind the beer.  I'll stand that,\" said Gorman, dragging his\nfriend away.\n\nNed consented to be dragged, and said something to the effect that he\nhoped to have the pleasure of standing treat on some future occasion.\n\n\"Now, then,\" said Gorman, somewhat firmly, though not sternly, for he\nknew that Ned Hooper was not to be browbeat; \"are you sober enough to\nattend to what I've got to say?\"\n\n\"Shober as a dudge,\" answered Ned.\n\nGorman looked earnestly in his face for a few moments, and then began to\ntalk to him in a continuous strain by way of testing him.\n\n\"C'found these cabs an' b-busseses; a feller c-can't hear a word,\" said\nNed.\n\n\"Your lodgin's an't far off, are they?\"\n\n\"Close 't 'and,\" answered Ned.\n\n\"Let's go to 'em,\" said Gorman.\n\nIn silence Ned Hooper led the way, and, conducting his friend into his\n\"chamber,\" as he styled his poor abode, begged him to be seated, and\nthrew himself into an armchair beside the little fire.  There was a pipe\non the chimney-piece, which Ned began to fill, while Gorman opened the\nconversation.\n\n\"You're hard up, rather, just now?\" said the latter.\n\n\"'Xactly so, that's my c'ndition to a tee.\"\n\nNed smiled as he said this, as though it were the most satisfactory\nstate of things possible, and lighted his pipe.\n\n\"Of course you've no objection to make a fifty pound note or so?\" asked\nGorman.\n\n\"None in sh' wo'ld; always,\" he became very earnest here, \"_always_\nsh'posin' that I make it honestly.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course,\" rejoined the other; \"I would never propose\nanything that would lead you into a scrape.  You don't suppose I would\ndo that, I hope?\"\n\n\"Shertenly not,\" replied Ned with a smile; \"fire away.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I'm anxious just now to procure a dead corpse.\"\n\nNed Hooper, drunk as he was, felt somewhat startled by this, but, being\na man of wandering and lively imagination, turned from the point in\nquestion to an idea suggested by it.\n\n\"I sh'pose a living corpse wouldn't do, would it?  It must be a dead\none--eh?\"\n\n\"Be serious if you can,\" said Gorman angrily.  \"I want a corpse.\"\n\nNed Hooper, who, like many good-humoured men, was easily roused when in\na state of intoxication, fired at the tone of Gorman's voice, and looked\nat him as sternly as he could, while he replied:\n\n\"What have _I_ got to do with yer wants an' yer co'pses--eh?  You don't\nsh'pose I keep a stock of 'em on hand ready-made, do you--eh?\"  Then\nrelapsing into a placid frame, he smiled, and added, \"But fire away, ol'\nfeller, I'm yer man for conv'sashin, specially w'en it's in the comic\nline.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said Gorman, clapping Ned on the shoulder and\nendeavouring to conciliate him; \"now, then, the question is, how am I to\nget 'un?\"\n\n\"Ah, thash the question, if Shakspr's to be b'lieved.\"\n\n\"Well, but couldn't you think?\" said Gorman.\n\n\"Think!\" exclaimed the other, \"what am I paid a salary for?  What are my\nbrains doin' night an day--eh?  Of course I can think; thash's my\npr'feshion, is thinking.\"\n\nGorman cast a scornful look at his friend, but he deemed it prudent to\nadmit the truth of what he said, and suggested that he might perhaps\nremember a certain medical student with whom he had once held pleasant\nconverse in his (Gorman's) house of entertainment.\n\n\"R'member him, of course,\" hiccuped Ned.\n\n\"Well, then, he could get us a corpse, you know--couldn't he?\"\n\nNed looked uncommonly knowing at this point, and admitted that he rather\nthought he could--a dozen of them, if necessary.\n\n\"Well, I want one, and I'll pay well for it if it's of the right sort.\nIt must be at least six-foot two, thin about the jaws, with lanky black\nhair, and a yellow complexion.\"\n\nNed smiled facetiously, but at the same time shook his head.\n\n\"Six f't two,\" said he, \"an't a common height; it won't be easy to get\n'un so tall; but--but,\" he pondered here with a grave expression of\ncountenance, \"but it might be stretched a bit, you know--eh?  As to thin\njaws, most of 'em is thin about sh' jaws, an' black hair ain't un--\nuncommon.\"\n\nNed yawned at this point, and looked very sleepy.\n\n\"Well, you'll speak to him, won't you, and I'll make it worth while for\nboth of you?\"\n\n\"Oh yesh, I'll shpeak to him,\" said Ned, as his head fell on the table\nand his senses utterly forsook him.\n\n\"Bah! you beast,\" muttered Gorman, casting a glance of scorn on his\nfriend as he rose to leave.  He had the sense, before going, to\nextinguish the candle, lest Ned should overturn it and set the house on\nfire; not that he cared either for Ned or the house, but as the former\nhappened to be necessary to him just then, he did not wish him to be\nburned too soon.  Then he went out, closing the door softly after him.\n\nHalf an hour afterwards Ned's friend and fellow-lodger, John Barret,\nentered the room, accompanied by Fred Auberly.\n\n\"Come, Fred,\" said the former, \"we can chat here without interr--\nhallo--\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\" inquired Fred, endeavouring to make out objects by the\nfeeble flicker of the fire, while his friend struck a light.\n\nBarret did not reply, but the light soon revealed Ned's disreputable\nfigure half sprawling on and half clinging to the table.\n\n\"Surely this is not your chum, John?\" asked Fred in surprise.\n\n\"Yes, that's him,\" answered Barret in a low sad voice.  \"Help me to get\nhim into bed, like a good fellow.\"\n\nWithout a word the young men raised the drunken figure in their arms,\nand laid it like some loathsome object on one of the beds in the\nadjoining room.\n\n\"How can you stay with him?\" asked Auberly, after they had returned to\nthe other room and seated themselves at the fire.\n\n\"He is an old schoolfellow of mine,\" said Barret in a low voice.  \"I'm\nsorry you've seen him in this state.  He was a very different fellow\nonce, I assure you; and if it were not for that accursed drink he would\nbe as pleasant a companion as exists.  You know I have no friends in\nLondon save yourself, Fred, and this young fellow.--I came to stay with\nhim at first, not knowing his character, and now I remain to try to--\nto--save him; but I fear his case is hopeless.  Come, Fred, we won't\ntalk of it.  You were saying, as we came along, that your father is\nsterner than ever, were you not?\"\n\n\"Ay,\" said Fred, with a sigh, \"he won't even let me call to see my\nsister too--that's the worst of it.  For the rest I care not; my brush\nhas sustained me hitherto, and my love for my profession increases every\nhour.  I feel towards it, John, as a man may be supposed to feel towards\nthe sweet, young girl whom wicked guardians had for a long time refused\nto let him wed.  Nothing but death shall separate us now!\"\n\nBarret smiled, and was about to make some rejoinder, but he checked\nhimself and changed the subject.\n\n\"How is your sister?\" said he, \"I have not heard of her for a long\ntime.\"\n\n\"Not well,\" answered Fred; \"the doctors shake their heads and speak of\nthe shock having been too much for her.  Dear Loo, she never was strong,\nand I'm afraid that she has received fatal injury on the night of the\nfire.  I'm told that my poor father is sadly cut up about her--attends\non her night and day, and humours her every whim.  This is so unlike him\nthat it fills me with anxiety on account of dear Loo, whom I have not\nseen since I went to live at Kensington.\"\n\n\"Kensington, Fred?  I did not know you had gone to live there.\"\n\n\"I was just going to mention that when we came in.  I have got a very\ncomfortable lodging with--who do you think? you'll never guess--Mrs\nWillders, the mother of our young friend Willie who works with old Tom\nTippet upstairs.  You may well look surprised.  I came upon the lodging\nquite accidentally, and, finding that it suited my inclinations and my\npurse, I took it at once for a few weeks.  It's in a very poor locality,\nno doubt, but you know a man must cut his coat according to his cloth,\nand my cloth is not broad at present.  But then,\" continued Fred, with\nsudden animation, \"it's a splendid place for a painter!  There are such\npicturesque regions and bits near it.  Why, Kensington Gardens are\nsufficient to make the fortune of a landscape-painter--at least in the\nway of trees; then an hour's walk takes you to rural scenery, or canal\nscenery, with barges, bridges, boats, old stores, cottages, etcetera.\nOh! it's a magnificent spot, and I'm hard at work on a picturesque old\npump near Shepherd's Bush Common, with a bit of old brick wall behind\nit, half-covered with ivy, and a gipsy-like beggar-girl drinking at it\nout of her hand; that--that'll make an impression, I think, on the Royal\nAcademy, if--if _they take it in_.\"\n\n\"Ah! _if_ they take it in,\" said John Barret, smiling.\n\n\"Well,\" retorted Fred Auberly, \"I know that is a point of uncertainty,\nand I'm not very sanguine, because there is great lack of room.\nNevertheless, I mean to send it.  And you know, John, \\`faint heart never\nwon fair lady,' so--\"\n\nAt this point the conversation was interrupted by a shrill whistle at\nthe top of the house, which, as it drew nearer, became identified with\nthe air of \"Rule Britannia!\"\n\n\"That's Willie Willders,\" said Barret, laughing.\n\n\"I guessed as much, and with your leave I'll call him in.  He knows of\nmy having become an inmate of his mother's house, and as he is probably\ngoing home I would like to send a message to his mother.  Hallo,\nWillie.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, sir!\" answered the youth, in the tones of a thoroughbred\nseaman.  Not that Willie had ever been at sea, but he was so fond of\nseamen, and had mingled with them so much at the docks, as well as those\nof them who had become firemen, that he tried to imitate their gait and\ntones.\n\n\"Come here, you scamp, and stop your noise.\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir,\" said Willie, with a grin, as he entered the room, cap\nin hand.\n\n\"Going home, lad?\" asked Fred.\n\n\"Yes, sir--at least in a permiscuous sort of way entertainin' myself as\nI goes with agreeable talk, and improvin' obsarvation of the shop\nwinders, etceterrer.\"\n\n\"Will you take a message to your mother?\"\n\n\"Sure-ly,\" answered Willie.\n\n\"Well, say to her that I have several calls to make to-night and may be\nlate in getting home, but she need not sit up for me as I have the\ndoor-key; tell her not to forget to leave the door on the latch.\"\n\n\"Wery good, sir,\" said Willie.  \"May I make so bold as to ask how Miss\nLoo was when you seed her last?\"\n\n\"Not well, I regret to say,\" replied Fred.\n\n\"Indeed!  I'm surprised to hear that, for she's agoin' out to tea\nto-morrow night, sir.\"\n\n\"My surprise is greater than yours, lad; how d'you know that, and where\nis she going to?\" asked Auberly.\n\nHere Willie explained in a very elaborate manner that a note had arrived\nthat forenoon from Miss Tippet, inviting Mr Tippet to tea the following\nevening, and expressing a hope that he would bring with him his clerk,\n\"_Mister_\" Willders, the brother of the brave fireman who had saved\nLoo's life, and that Miss Louisa Auberly was to be there, and that Mr\nTippet had written a note accepting the same.\n\n\"Then you'll have to take another message from me, Willie.  Tell Miss\nTippet when you go to-morrow that I will give myself the pleasure of\nlooking in on her in the course of the evening,\" said Fred.  \"Mr\nAuberly is not to be there, is he?\"\n\n\"No, not as I knows of.\"\n\n\"Well, good-night, Willie.\"\n\nWillie took his departure, marching to the usual national air, and soon\nafter Fred Auberly bade his friend good-night and left him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY ONE.\n\nA SMALL TEA-PARTY.\n\nMiss Tippet's tea-party began by the arrival of Willie Willders, who,\nbeing fond of society, and regardless of fashion, understood his hostess\nliterally when she named her tea-hour!  For full half an hour,\ntherefore, he had the field to himself, and improved the occasion by\nentertaining Miss Tippet and Emma Ward with an account of the wonderful\ninventions that emanated from the fertile brain of Mr Thomas Tippet.\n\nStrange to say, a deep and lasting friendship had sprung up between the\neccentric old gentleman and his volatile assistant.  Willie sympathised\nso fully with his master in his wild schemes, and displayed withal such\nan aptitude for mechanical contrivance, and such a ready appreciation of\ncomplex theories, that Mr Tippet soon came to forget his extreme youth,\nand to converse with him, propound schemes and new ideas to him, and\neven to ask his advice; with as much seriousness as though he had been a\nfull-grown man.\n\nThis was of course very gratifying to Willie, who repaid his master's\ncondescension and kindness by devoting himself heart and soul to the\nduties of what he styled his \"profession.\"  He was a good deal put out\nwhen his brother Frank asked him one day what his \"profession\" was, and\nresolving never again to be placed in such an awkward position of\nignorance, asked his employer what was the name of his business, to\nwhich the employer replied that it had no particular name; but, on being\nurged by his assistant to give it a name, he suggested that he might, if\nso disposed, style himself a poly-artist, which, he explained, meant an\nartist of many occupations.  Willie felt that this might be translated\n\"jack-of-all-trades,\" but on mature consideration he resolved to adopt\nit, in the belief that few people would understand what it meant, and\nthat thereby he would be invested with a halo of mystery, which was,\nupon the whole, a gratifying reflection.\n\nGradually, however, Willie was led to diverge from his employer to his\nbrother Frank, in regard to whom Miss Tippet entertained the strongest\nfeelings of admiration, because of his courageous conduct in saving\nLouisa Auberly.  Willie pursued this theme all the more willingly that\nEmma appeared to be deeply interested in it.\n\nEmma Ward was very romantic in her nature; yet she had a keen\nappreciation of the ludicrous,--which caused her to appear somewhat\nlight-headed and giddy in the eyes of superficial observers; but she\npossessed an underlying earnestness of soul, which displayed itself in a\nthousand ways to those who had much intercourse with her.  She was an\nardent hero-worshipper; and while Miss Tippet was her heroine, Frank\nWillders was, at that time, her _beau ideal_ of a hero, although she\nonly knew him from description.\n\nWillie was still in the middle of a glowing account of a fire, in which\nFrank and his friends Dale and Baxmore were the chief actors; and Emma\nwas listening with heightened colour, parted lips, and sparkling eyes,\nwhen Matty Merryon opened the door and announced Mr Tippet.\n\nThat gentleman was still in the act of shaking his sister's hands with\nboth of his, and kissing her on both cheeks heartily, when Matty\nannounced Miss Deemas.\n\nMatty, being Irish, allowed her soul to gush out too obviously in her\ntones; so that her feelings towards the Eagle, though unexpressed, were\ndiscernible.\n\nMiss Deemas strode up to Miss Tippet, and pecked her on the right cheek,\nmuch as an eagle might peck a tender rabbit, which it could slay and\ndevour if it chose, but which it preferred to spare for a time.  She was\nimmediately introduced to Mr Tippet, whom she favoured with a stiff\nbow, intended to express armed neutrality in the meantime; with a\npossibility, if not a probability, of war in the future.  The eccentric\ngentleman felt chilled, but ventured to express an opinion in regard to\nthe weather, glancing for confirmation of the same towards the window,\nthrough which he naturally enough expected to see the sky; but was\nbaffled by only seeing the green venetian blinds, which ruled off the\nopposite houses in narrow stripes.  Before he had recovered himself to\nmake any further observation, Miss Deemas had attempted, in a\ncondescending way, to peck the cheek of Emma Ward; but that young lady,\nfeeling disinclined, so managed that she received the peck on her\nforehead.\n\nOn Willie, Miss Deemas bestowed a glance of utter indifference, which\nWillie replied to with a gaze of desperate defiance.\n\nThen Miss Deemas seated herself on the sofa, and asked her \"dear friend\"\nhow she did, and how she felt, and whether things in general were much\nas usual; from which elevated region of generalities she gradually\ndescended into the more particular sphere of gossip and scandal.\n\nIt is only just to Miss Tippet to say that the Eagle did not find her a\ncongenial bird of prey in this region.  On the contrary, she had to drag\nher unwilling friend down into it; and as Miss Tippet was too\nconscientious and kind-hearted to agree with her in her sweeping\ncensures and caustic observations and wilful misconstructions, it is\ndifficult to conceive wherein she (the Eagle) found pleasure in her\nsociety.  Probably it was because she found in her one who would submit\nmeekly to any amount of contradiction, and listen patiently to any\namount of vituperative declamation.\n\n\"So it seems Mr Auberly has disinherited and dismissed his son, my\ndear,\" said Miss Deemas, smoothing her dress with both hands, as though\nshe were about to lay Mr Auberly in her lap, and analyse him.\n\n\"I'm sorry to say that it is too true, Julia,\" answered Miss Tippet,\nwith a sigh.\n\n\"Ha! it's so like one of these creatures,\" said Miss Deemas, pursing her\nthin lips; \"so domineering, so towering, in their pride of mere physical\npower.\"\n\nMr Tippet glanced at the Eagle in surprise, not being able to\nunderstand to what sort of \"creatures\" she made reference.\n\n\"Poor Frederick,\" sighed Miss Tippet, \"I don't know what he'll do (ring\nthe bell, Emma, darling); he's such a bold, high-spirited young man, and\nit's all owing to his determination to take to--to what's-'is-name as a\nprofession (bring the tea, Matty).  It's very sad.\"\n\n\"That must be a new sort of profession,\" observed Miss Deemas pointedly.\n\n\"Oh!  I mean painting, you know.  It's impossible to arrange one's\nthings in such very correct language, you know, dear Julia; you are\nreally too--oh! did you hear of Joe Corney, and what's-his--fireman's\nvisit to Mrs Denman?  To be sure you did; I forgot it was in your\nhouse.  It was such a funny account; you heard of it, brother (ring the\nbell again, dear), didn't you?\"\n\nMr Tippet, whose wonted vivacity was quite subdued by the freezing\ninfluence of the Eagle, said that he had not heard of it; whereupon Miss\nTippet said that she had heard of it, and so had Willie Willders, who\nhad heard of it from his brother Frank, who had heard of it from Joe\nCorney himself; and then she attempted to relate the matter, but failed,\nand finally asked Willie to tell the story, which Willie did with much\ngusto; looking at Miss Deemas all the time, and speaking in a very\npositive tone, as if he thought she was doubting every word he said, and\nwas resolved to hurl it in her teeth, whether she chose to believe it or\nnot.\n\n\"Capital!\" exclaimed Mr Tippet, laughing heartily, when Willie had\nconcluded; \"what an energetic old lady she must be!  Really, I must get\nintroduced to her, and show her the self-acting fire-extinguisher I have\njust invented.  You remember it, Willie?\"  Willie nodded.  \"I've laid it\naside for some time; but it is very nearly complete now.  A little more\nwork on it will finish it.  My only difficulty in regard to it is,\nmadam,\" he addressed himself to Miss Deemas here, \"that it is apt to\nburst, and I am uncertain whether or not to add a safety-valve to\nprevent such a catastrophe, or to make the metal so very strong, that\nnothing short of gunpowder would burst it; but then, you see, that would\nmake the whole affair too heavy.  However, these are only minor\ndifficulties of detail, which a little thought will overcome.\"\n\nMiss Deemas received all this with a sinister smile, and replied with\nthe single word, \"Oh!\" after which she turned immediately to Miss\nTippet, and remarked that the weather had been unusually warm of late\nfor the season of the year, which remark so exasperated Willie Willders\nthat he turned with a face of crimson to Emma, and asked her if she\ndidn't feel a draught of cold air coming over her from somewhere, and\nwhether she would not sit nearer the fire, and farther away from the\nwindow!\n\nWillie meant this for an uncommonly severe cut; for Miss Deemas sat at\nthe end of the sofa, near the window!\n\nFortunately, at this point, Matty Merryon ushered in Loo Auberly, who\nwas instantly enfolded in Miss Tippet's arms, and thence transferred to\nEmma's, in which she was led to the sofa, and gently deposited in the\nsoftest corner.\n\n\"Darling Loo!\" exclaimed Miss Tippet, with tears in her eyes; \"you look\n_so_ thin and pale.\"\n\nThere could be no doubt on that point.  Little Loo, as Emma styled her,\nwas worn to a shadow by sickness, which had hitherto baffled the\ndoctor's skill.  But she was a beautiful shadow; such a sweet, gentle\nshadow, that one might feel thankful, rather than otherwise, to be\nhaunted by it.\n\n\"Pray don't mind me; I'm too tired to speak to you yet; just go on\ntalking.  I like to listen,\" said Loo softly.\n\nWith ready kindness, Miss Tippet at once sought to draw attention from\nthe child, by reverting to Mrs Denman; and Matty created a little\nopportune confusion by stumbling into the room with the tea.\n\nMatty usually tripped over the carpet at the door, and never seemed to\nbecome wiser from experience.\n\n\"Poor Mrs Denman,\" said Miss Tippet, pouring out the tea; \"it must have\nbeen an awful shock; think of a (Sugar, brother?  I always forget), what\nwas I--oh, yes; think of a fireman seizing one round the (Cream, Willie?\nI know you have a sweet tooth, so I don't need to ask if you take\nsugar)--yes, he carried her down that dreadful what-d'ye-call-it, and\ninto the next house with nothing (A little more sugar, Julia?  No? )--\nnothing on but her what's-'is-name.  Oh! it was sad; sad to lose all her\nfine things, too--her furniture, and--and thingumies.  Do try a piece of\ncake, brother.\"\n\n\"I know a worse case than hers,\" said Willie, with a knowing look.\n\n\"Do you?\" exclaimed Miss Tippet.\n\n\"Oh! do tell it,\" cried Emma earnestly; \"he's just been telling it to\nme, and it is _so_ sad and interesting.\"\n\n\"Come, let's hear about it, lad,\" said Mr Tippet.\n\nThus encouraged, Willie related his adventure with the clown's family,\nand told his tale with such genuine feeling, that Miss Tippet, Loo, and\nEmma found their eyes moist when he had concluded.\n\nThere was a good deal of comment upon this subject, and Miss Deemas\nanimadverted very strongly upon actors in general and clowns in\nparticular.  As to ballet-girls, she could not find words to express her\ncontempt for them; but in reference to this Miss Tippet ventured to\nrebuke her friend, and to say that although she could not and would not\ndefend the position of these unfortunates, yet she felt that they were\nvery much to be pitied, seeing that they were in many cases trained to\ntheir peculiarly indelicate life by their parents, and had been taught\nto regard ballet-dancing as quite a proper and legitimate\nwhat's-its-name.  No doubt this was only a palliation of the life they\nled, but she thought that if anyone was to be severely blamed in the\nmatter it was the people who went to witness and encourage such wicked\ndisplays.\n\nMiss Deemas dissented generally from all her friend's observations, and,\nwishing to change the subject, asked Loo if her father was coming to\nfetch her home.\n\n\"No,\" said Loo; \"dear papa is not well to-night, but he is to send the\ncarriage for me.  Oh, I wish,\" she continued, reverting to the previous\nsubject, \"I _wish_ I could do something for these poor people.  I'm so\nvery, very sorry for the fairy.\"\n\n\"So you can, if you choose,\" said Miss Deemas sharply.\n\n\"No, indeed I cannot,\" replied Loo in an earnest voice; \"I'm too ill and\nweak now to be of any use to anyone.  Once I was useful to dear papa,\nbut ever since the fire I have not been of use to anybody; only a\nhindrance to them.  Since I have been ill I have thought much more about\nwhat I read in the Bible, and I've had a great desire to do good in some\nway or other, but how can I--so weak and helpless?\"\n\nLoo almost sobbed, for her sympathies had been awakened by Willie, and a\nchord had been touched which had been vibrating in her breast for some\nweeks past.\n\n\"Your father is rich, is he not?\" asked the Eagle.\n\n\"Yes, I believe so.\"\n\n\"Well, a word to him may be the cause of much good, in the shape of\nmoney at least, to people in distress; but rich people don't always like\nto spend their money in that way.\"\n\nLoo hung down her head and made no reply, for she knew that her father\ndid not like to part with money.  She had often heard him refuse to do\nso in days gone by, even when very pathetic appeals (as she thought)\nwere made to him; and experience told her that it was in vain to look\nfor help in that quarter.\n\nThe party was now increased by the arrival of Frederick Auberly, who at\nonce infused life into everybody, except Miss Deemas, who had life\nenough of her own, and would by no means accept the loan of any from\nanyone else.  Fred therefore ignored her altogether, and told stories\nand cracked jokes and sang songs as if no such female iceberg were\npresent.\n\nPoor Loo was overjoyed to see him, and laying her head on his breast,\nbade him speak away and not ask questions; only speak, and allow her to\nlisten and rest.\n\nFred obeyed, and at once began an earnest discussion with Willie as to\nthe best method of getting a stout gentleman out of a third-floor window\nin case of fire, when Matty Merryon entered with a flushed face and said\nthat a fireman who would not give his name wished to see Willie Willders\nfor a minute; and she was inclined to think it was his brother.\n\n\"What!  Frank?\" exclaimed Willie, rising to go downstairs.\n\n\"Stay, Willie,\" cried Miss Tippet eagerly; \"don't go down.  Pray let me\nhave him up; I should so like to see him, and I'm sure so would Loo; the\nman, you know, who went up the what's-its-name, and brought you--yes,\nsend him up, Matty.\"\n\n\"Plaze, mim, he won't come,\" replied the girl, \"I know'd ye would like\nto see him, an' axed him in.\"\n\n\"Tell him,\" said Miss Tippet, \"that I request it as a favour.\"\n\nWhile Matty was delivering this message, the Eagle took occasion to\nsniff once or twice in a contemptuous manner, and wondered why people\nworshipped men just because they happened to be big, and what they\ncalled handsome.  For her part, she hated all men, but if she were to be\nobliged to choose between any class (which she was thankful to say was\n_not_ necessary in her case), she would certainly give the preference to\nugly men and small.\n\nWillie Willders nodded his head approvingly, and, being exasperated into\na savage serio-comic condition, as well by the Eagle's voice and aspect\nas by her sentiments, he said that she was quite right, and that if _he_\nwere a lady like her he would hold the same opinions, because then, said\nhe, \"being stout, I could wallop my husband an' keep him down, an' the\ncontrast of his ugly face with mine would not be so obvious.\"\n\nFrank's step on the stair fortunately prevented this open and desperate\nattack being noticed.  Next moment all turned their eyes in breathless\nexpectation towards the door.\n\nBeing on duty, Frank appeared in fireman's costume, with the sailor-like\nundress cap in his hand.  He bowed to the company, and apologised to\nMiss Tippet for intruding, but he had wished to ask his brother Willie\nto call at the fire station on his way home to convey a letter to his\nmother, and merely meant to see him at the door.\n\n\"I'm _very_ glad you came, Mr Willders,\" said Miss Tippet, \"for I\nassure you we all regard you as the preserver of our dear Miss Auberly's\nlife when you went up the--the--thing.  Here she is.  You must shake--\nthat's it--so nice!\"\n\nThe last part of Miss Tippet's remark referred to Loo stretching out her\nhand to Frank, who advanced promptly and shook it with great tenderness.\nHe then shook hands with Fred, who expressed his regard for him in warm\nterms; also with Mr Tippet, who paid him some enthusiastic compliments,\nand said something to the effect that the parent stem from which two\nsuch branches as he and Willie had grown must be a prime plant.\n\nAs he turned from Mr Tippet--who, being very short, appeared to be\nlooking up at a steeple while he delivered this opinion--Frank's eyes\nencountered those of Emma Ward, who was gazing at him in such\nundisguised admiration, that, being a somewhat bashful man, he felt a\nlittle confused, and dropped his eyes, figuratively, on the floor.  Emma\nblushed scarlet with shame at being caught in this way, and thereafter\nbecame rigidly grave and indifferent.\n\nWhen Frank again raised his eyes--which, by the way, he did\nimmediately--they encountered the eagle glance of Miss Deemas frowning\ndefiance on him, as being a sort of type or pattern specimen of his\nhighly objectionable race.  Had Miss Deemas been a man (which would have\ngratified her more than she could have expressed) Frank could have met\nthe frown with a smile of pity.  As it was, he turned to the little\neager countenance of Miss Tippet, and felt deeper respect than ever for\nthe sex; thus showing that just as an exception proves a rule, so an\nunfavourable contrast strengthens a cause.\n\n\"Pray sit down, Mr Willders,\" entreated Miss Tippet earnestly; \"I\nshould like _so_ much to hear how you did it from your own lips, and how\nyou can possibly venture up such dreadful things, just like going up the\noutside of the Monument.  Dear Loo, and you came down it, too; but, to\nbe sure, your eyes were shut, which was as well, for you were only in\nyour night--Ah, well, yes, _do_ sit down Mr Firem---Willders, I mean.\"\n\nFrank thanked her, but declined, on the ground that he was on duty, and\nthat he feared he was doing wrong in even looking in on them for the few\nminutes he had stayed.  \"Good-night, ma'am,\" he continued, \"good-night.\nYou'll call at the station on your way home, Willie?\"\n\nWillie said he would, and then all the company, excepting the Eagle,\nshook hands with the stalwart fireman, looking up at him as if he were a\nhero just returned from the proverbial \"hundred fights.\"  Even Emma Ward\ncondescended to shake hands with him at parting.\n\n\"Perhaps you'll be in the middle of a fire this very night,\" cried Tom\nTippet, following him to the door.\n\n\"It is quite possible,\" said Frank, with a smile.\n\nMiss Deemas was heard to snort contemptuously at this.\n\n\"Perhaps you may even save more lives!\" cried Miss Tippet.\n\n\"It may be so,\" answered Frank, again smiling, but evidently feeling\nanxious to make his escape, for he was not one of those men who like to\nbe lionised.\n\n\"Only think!\" exclaimed Miss Tippet as Frank quitted the room.\n\n\"Ha!\" ejaculated the Eagle, in a tone which was meant to convey her\nwell-known opinion that women would do such things quite as well as men\nif their muscles were a little stronger.\n\nIt is but justice to Miss Deemas to explain that she did not champion\nand exalt women out of love to her sex.  Love was not one of her strong\npoints.  Rampant indignation against those whom she bitterly termed\n\"lords of creation\" was her strong tower of refuge, in which she\nhabitually dwelt, and from the giddy summit of which she hurled would-be\ndestruction on the doomed males below.  Among her various missiles she\ncounted the \"wrongs of her sex\" the most telling shaft, and was in\nconsequence always busy sharpening and polishing and flourishing this\ndread weapon in the eyes of her friends as well as her enemies,\nalthough, of course, she only launched it at the latter.\n\nPerched on her self-exalted eyrie, Miss Deemas did not know that there\nwas a pretty large number of her own sex in the comparatively humble\nmultitude below, who, while they clearly recognised the \"wrongs of\nwomen\" (and preferred to call them \"misfortunes\") did not attribute them\nsolely, or even largely, to the wickedness of men, but to the combined\nwickedness and folly of society in general, and who were of opinion that\nsuch matters were to be put right by patient, persevering, laborious,\nand persistent efforts on the part of men and women acting in concert,\nand not by the unwomanly acts and declamation of ladies of the Deemas\nstamp, whom they counted the worst enemies of the good cause--some\nwittingly, others unwittingly so.  These people among the comparatively\nhumble multitude below, also had the penetration to perceive that the\nso-called \"wrongs\" did not lie all on one side, but that there was a\npretty large class of the so-called \"lords\" who went about the world\nhabitually in a sad and disgraceful state of moral semi-nakedness, in\nconsequence of their trousers having been appropriated and put on by\ntheir better-halves, and that therefore it was only meet that men and\nwomen should be united (as indeed they were from the first intended to\nbe) in their efforts to put each other's \"wrongs\" to \"rights.\"\n\nIn addition to all this, these weak-minded (shall we call them?) people,\nmoving in the comparatively humble multitude below, entertained the\nbelief that rising in antagonism to the male sex in this matter was not\nonly unnecessary and unjust and impolitic, but also ungenerous, for they\nreflected with much calm satisfaction that the \"lords\" are, after all,\n\"under woman's control.\"\n\nBut Miss Deemas and all the ladies of the Eagle stamp did not think so.\nThey did not believe that a strong mind means a mind strong enough to\nexercise its own powers to the ascertainment and reception of truth and\nthe rejection of falsehood and fallacy; strong enough, under the\ninfluence of God's love, to perceive the paths of duty in all their\nramifications, and to resolve to follow them.  They did not believe that\na high spirit, in the true sense of the word, meant a spirit broken down\naltogether and brought into subjection to its owner's, not another's,\nwill.  By no means.  A strong mind with the Deemas-eagles meant\nunutterable and unalterable obstinacy, blind as a bat, with the great\nguns blazing all round, and the colours nailed to the mast.  High spirit\nwith them meant the inclination--ever present, always strong, and often\nasserted--to seize all the rest of the world, male and female, and lead\nit by the nose!\n\nThe Deemas-eagles as a class receive ready-made opinions, fabricated by\nsomeone else, and call them their own--receiving them originally and\nholding them subsequently, not because they are true, but because they\nare pleasant to their eyes and sweet to their taste.  They hold them\nstoutly, too, probably because, having no foundation, they would be apt\nto fall and get broken if not upheld.\n\nHaving said thus much in behalf of the Deemas eagles, we now dismiss\nthem, with an apology to the reader.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY TWO.\n\nA FIREMAN'S LIFE.\n\nThe clocks were striking nine when Frank issued from Miss Tippet's\ndwelling and walked briskly away.  On turning a corner he came upon one\nof the numerous fire-escapes that nightly rear their tall heads against\nthe houses all over London, in a somewhat rampant way, as though they\nknew of the fires that were about to take place, and, like mettlesome\nwar-horses, were anxious to rush into action without delay.\n\nOn the pavement, close by the escape, stood a small sentry-box, and the\nmoment Frank came in sight of it he remembered that it was the nocturnal\nhabitation of his friend Conductor Samuel Forest.  Sam himself was\nleaning his arms on the lower half of his divided door, and gazing\ncontemplatively along the street.\n\n\"Well, Sam, what news?\" inquired Frank as he came up.\n\n\"That you, Willders?\" said Sam, a quiet smile of recognition playing on\nhis good-humoured features.  \"I thought it must be the giant they're\nexhibitin' in Saint James's Hall just now, takin' a stroll at night to\nescape the boys.  Why, when do you mean to stop growing?\"\n\n\"I don't mean to interfere with Nature at all,\" replied Frank; \"and I\nbelieve the world will be big enough to hold me, whatever size I grow\nto.\"\n\n\"Well, what's the news?\" inquired Sam, emerging from his narrow\nresidence, and proving in the act, that, though not quite so tall as his\nfriend, he was one who required a pretty fair share of room in the world\nfor himself.\n\n\"Nothing particular,\" said Frank, leaning against the escape; \"only a\nchimney and a cut-away affair last night, and a false alarm and a\nfirst-floor burnt out the day before.\"\n\n\"How's Thompson?\" asked Forest.\n\n\"Poorly, I fear,\" said Frank, with a shake of his head.  \"The sprained\nankle he got when he fell off the folding-board is getting well, but the\ninjury to his spine from the engine is more serious.\"\n\n\"Ah! poor fellow!\" said Forest, \"he's just a little too reckless.  How\ncame he by the sprain?\"\n\n\"It was in the basement of a bookbinder's in Littleton Street,\" said\nFrank, lighting a cigar.  \"We got the call about 11 p.m., and on getting\nthere found three engines at work.  Mr Braidwood ordered our fellows to\ngo down into the basement.  It was very dark, and so thick of smoke that\nI couldn't see half-an-inch before my nose.  We broke through the\nwindows, and found ourselves ankle-deep in water.  The engines had been\nat work flooding the place for some time, and there was more water than\nwe expected; but we had got on the folding-boards without knowing it,\nan' before we knew where we were, down went Thompson into water four\nfeet deep.  I think myself some of the water-pipes had burst.  He rose\ngasping, and I caught him by the collar and hauled him out.  It was in\ntrying to recover himself when he fell that he got the sprain.  You've\nheard how he came by the other mishap?\"\n\n\"Yes, it was gallopin' down Ludgate Hill, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Ay; the engine went over a barrow, and the jolt threw him off, and\nbefore he got up it was on him.  By good fortune it did not go over him;\nit only bruised his back; but it's worse than we thought it would be, I\nfear.\"\n\n\"Ah! one never knows,\" said Forest gravely.  \"There's one man Jackson,\nnow, only two weeks ago he was up in a third floor in Lambeth, and had\nbrought down two women and a child, and was in the back-rooms groping\nfor more, when the floor above gave way and came down on him.  We all\nthought he was done for, but some of the beams had got jammed, and not\nfive minutes after he steps out of a window all right--only a scratch or\ntwo, not worth mentioning; yet that same man fell down a flight of\nstairs at the same fire, with a boy on his shoulder, and sprained his\nankle so bad that he's bin laid up for three weeks; but he saved the\nboy.\"\n\n\"Ah! it was worth the sprain,\" said Frank.\n\n\"It was,\" responded Forest.\n\n\"Well, good-night,\" said Frank, resuming his walk.\n\nSamuel Forest responded \"good-night,\" and then, getting into his box,\nsat down on its little seat, which was warranted not to hold two,\ntrimmed the lamp that hung at his side, and, pulling out a book from a\ncorner, began to peruse it.\n\nSam was of a literary turn of mind.  He read a great deal during his\nlonely watches, and used often to say that some of his happiest hours\nwere those spent in the dead of night in his sentry-box.  His helmet\nhung on a peg beside him.  His hatchet was in his girdle, and a small\ncap covered his head.  Looking at him in his snug and brightly\nilluminated little apartment, he appeared--by contrast with the\nsurrounding darkness--inexpressibly comfortable.  Nevertheless, Sam\nForest could have told you that appearances are often deceptive, and\nthat no matter how it looked, his box was but a cold habitation on a\nbiting December night.\n\nWhile deeply immersed in his book, Sam heard the sound of approaching\nfootsteps, and pricked up his ears.  He was a good judge of such sounds.\nAs they drew near, he quietly took off his cap, put on his helmet, and\nstepped from his box.  The street was very silent; and, perhaps, not one\nof the hundreds of sleepers there thought of the solitary man who held\nvigil, and was so alert to do them service, if the hour of their\nextremity should come.\n\nBut a cry arose that startled them--\"Fire! fire!!\"\n\nAnother moment, and two men dashed round the corner, yelling at the top\nof their voices.  Gasping for breath, they named the locality.  Almost\nbefore they had done so, two policemen were on the spot, and in another\nmoment the fire-escape was in motion.  Instructed by the conductor, the\ntwo strangers and the policemen lent their willing aid.  Before ten\nminutes had passed, the tall machine was run up to a burning house, the\nlower part of which was blazing; while, from the upper windows, frantic\ncries were heard for help, and sundry figures in dishabille were seen\nwaving their arms.  The escape was run up, and one after another the\ninmates were rescued from their perilous position.\n\nWhile this scene was enacting Frank was pursuing his way to the Regent\nStreet Fire Station; but news of the fire got there before him.  He\narrived just in time to don his helmet and take his place on the engine.\nAway they went, and in ten minutes after the arrival of the\nfire-escape, they dashed up, almost running into an engine which\nappeared from an opposite direction.\n\nThe fire was blazing brightly by this time, and the whole neighbourhood\nwas in a state of commotion and excitement.\n\nThe two engines were got to work with as little delay as possible.  A\nbody of police kept the gathering crowd back, and soon volumes of steam\nbegan to mingle with the black smoke of the burning building.  The\nsuperintendent was early on the scene, and he directed Frank and another\nfireman to try to persuade the people in the adjoining houses to remain\nquiet, and not throw their furniture over the window; but this, some of\nthem would not consent to do.  It was plain that one or two were mad\nwith fear and excitement; and as the ruling passion is strong in death,\nso it would seem to be by no means weak in the midst of danger from\nfire; for many of them bent their whole energies to the saving of their\ngoods and chattels--regardless of their lives.\n\nOne stout old gentleman, in particular, was seen at a third-floor\nwindow, heaving out chairs and stools and books, and small tables, and\nclocks, and even quantities of crockery, with desperate energy, to the\ngreat danger of the onlookers, at whose feet the various articles fell,\nand were dashed to atoms!\n\nFrank darted up the stairs that led to this man's apartments, and burst\nin upon him.\n\n\"Oh! come along, fireman; help me to save my things,\" he exclaimed, as\nhe struggled with superhuman efforts to thrust a table through the\nwindow, which was too small to permit its passage.\n\n\"Stop, sir, are you mad?\" cried Frank sternly.\n\n\"Help me! help me!  Oh! fireman, it will be all burned.  Fire! fire!\nfire!!!\"\n\nHis voice rose into a fierce yell, as he strove in vain with the table.\n\n\"You're quite safe,\" cried Frank, holding him; \"_your_ house ain't\nalight, and the engines have got it almost under.\"\n\nBut Frank spoke to deaf ears; so he coolly lifted the man in his arms,\ncarried him kicking downstairs, and placed him in charge of a policeman.\n\nJust then, a cry was raised that there were two kegs of gunpowder in one\nof the shops on the ground floor.  The owner of the shop came up in a\nfrantic state, and corroborated this statement.\n\n\"It'll blow the house to bits, sir,\" he said to Mr Braidwood.\n\n\"Of course it will,\" remarked the latter in a quiet voice.  \"Come here,\nmy man,\" he added, taking the shopkeeper apart from the crowd, and\nquestioning him closely.\n\nImmediately after, he ordered the engines to play on a particular part\nof the building.\n\nJust then, Frank came up to the superintendent.\n\n\"There's gunpowder in the back-shop somewhere, I'm told, sir; shall I go\nin for it?\"\n\n\"No, Willders; you couldn't find it in the smoke.  Take the branch, lad,\nand get up into that window above the door.\"\n\nFrank sprang to obey.  At the same time, Mr Braidwood suddenly seized a\nhorse-cloth, and dashed in through the smoke.  In a few seconds, he\nreturned with one of the kegs of powder in his arms.  Giving it to one\nof his men, he darted in again, and speedily re-issued with the second\nkeg of powder, amid the frantic cheering of the crowd.  Having done\nthis, he continued to superintend the men until the fire was got under,\nwhich was soon accomplished, having been attacked promptly and with\ngreat vigour soon after it broke out.\n\n\"You needn't wait, Mr Dale,\" said Braidwood, going up to his foreman.\n\"It's all safe now.  I'll keep one engine; but you and your lads get off\nto your beds as fast as ye can.\"\n\nDale obeyed, and a few minutes after, the engine was galloping\nhomewards.\n\nWillie Willders was in the station when it arrived, and so was Fred\nAuberly, who, having accompanied Willie, had got into such an\ninteresting talk with the sub-engineer in charge, that he forgot time,\nand was still in animated conversation when the wheels were heard in the\ndistance.\n\nThe three were out at the door in an instant.\n\nOn came the engine, the horses' feet and the wheels crashing harshly in\nthe silent night.  They came round the corner with a sharp swing.\nEither the driver had become careless, or he was very sleepy that night,\nfor he dashed against an iron post that stood at the corner, and carried\noff two wheels.  The engine went full thirty yards on the two\noff-wheels, before it came to the ground, which it did at last with a\nterrific crash, throwing the firemen violently to the ground.\n\nThe sub-engineer and Fred and Willie sprang forward in great alarm; but\nthe most of the men leaped up at once, and one or two of them laughed,\nas if to show that they had got no damage.  But one of them lay extended\non the pavement.  It needed not a second glance to tell that it was\nFrank Willders.\n\n\"Lift him gently, lads,\" said Dale, who was himself severely bruised.\n\n\"Stop,\" exclaimed Frank in a low voice; \"I've got no harm except to my\nleft leg.  It's broken, I think.  There's no use of lifting me till you\nget a cab.  I'll go straight home, if--\" He fainted as he spoke.\n\n\"Run for a cab, Willie,\" said Fred Auberly.\n\nWillie was off in a moment.  At the same instant, a messenger was\ndespatched for Dr Offley, and in a short time after that, Frank\nWillders was lying on his mother's sofa, with his left leg broken below\nthe knee.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY THREE.\n\nMR JAMES AUBERLY.\n\nWith a very stiff cravat, and a dreadfully stiff back, and a painfully\nstiff aspect, Mr James Auberly sat by the side of a couch and nursed\nhis sick child.\n\nStiff and starched and stern though he was, Mr Auberly, had a soft\npoint in his nature, and this point had been reached at last, for\nthrough all the stiffness and starch there shone on his countenance an\nexpression of deep anxiety as he gazed at Loo's emaciated form.\n\nMr Auberly performed the duties of a nurse awkwardly enough, not being\naccustomed to such work, but he did them with care and with an evident\neffort to please, which made a deep impression on the child's heart.\n\n\"Dear papa,\" she said, after he had given her a drink and arranged her\ncoverings.  \"I want you to do me a favour.\"  She said this timidly, for\nshe knew from past experience that her father was not fond of granting\nfavours, but since her illness he had been so kind to her that she felt\nemboldened to make her request.\n\n\"I will do it, dear,\" said the stiff man, bending, morally as well as\nphysically, as he had never bent before--for the prospect of Loo's death\nhad been presented to him by the physicians.  \"I will do it, dear, if I\ncan, and if the request be reasonable.\"\n\n\"Oh, then, do forgive Fred, and let him be an artist!\" cried Loo,\neagerly stretching out one of her thin hands.\n\n\"Hush, darling,\" said Mr Auberly, with a look of distress; \"you must\nnot excite yourself so.  I have forgiven Fred long ago, and he has\nbecome an artist in spite of my objections.\"\n\n\"Yes, but let him come home, I mean, and be happy with us again as he\nused to be, and go to the office with you,\" said Loo.\n\nMr Auberly replied somewhat coldly to this that Fred was welcome to\nreturn home if he chose, but that his place in the office had been\nfilled up.  Besides, it was impossible for him to be both a painter and\na man of business, he said, and added that Loo had better not talk about\nsuch things, because she did not understand them.  All he could say was\nthat he was willing to receive Fred, if Fred was willing to return.  He\ndid not say, however, that he was willing to restore Fred to his former\nposition in regard to his fortune, and as Loo knew nothing about her\nbrother having been disinherited, she felt that she must be satisfied\nwith this cold concession.\n\n\"Can you not ask some other favour, such as I could grant?\" said Mr\nAuberly, with a smile, which was not nearly so grim as it used to be\nbefore \"the fire.\"  (The family always talked of the burning of Mr\nAuberly's house as \"the fire,\" to the utter repudiation of all other\nfires--the great one of monumental fame included.)\n\nLoo meditated some time before replying.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" she exclaimed suddenly, \"I _have_ another favour to ask.  How\nstupid of me to forget it.  I want you very much to go and see a fairy\nthat lives--\"\n\n\"A fairy, Loo!\" said Mr Auberly, while a shade of anxiety crossed his\nface.  \"You--you are rather weak just now; I must make you be quiet, and\ntry to sleep, if you talk nonsense, dear.\"\n\n\"It's not nonsense,\" said Loo, again stretching out the thin hand, which\nher father grasped, replaced under the coverings, and held there; \"it's\nquite true, papa,\" she continued energetically! \"it _is_ a fairy I want\nyou to go and see--she's a pantomime fairy, and lives somewhere near\nLondon Bridge, and she's been very ill, and is so poor that they say\nshe's dying for want of good food.\"\n\n\"Who told you about her, Loo?\"\n\n\"Willie Willders,\" she replied, \"he has been to see her and her father\nthe clown a good many times.\"\n\nMr Auberly, frowned, for the name of Willie Willders did not sound\npleasantly in his ears.\n\n\"_Do_ go to see her, pray, dear papa,\" pleaded Loo with much\nearnestness, \"and give her some money.  You know that darling mamma\nsaid, just before she was taken away,\" (the poor child persistently\nrefused to use the expression \"when she died\"), \"she wanted you to take\nme sometimes to see poor people when they were sick, and I've often\nthought of that since--especially when I have come to the verse in my\nBible which tells me to \\`consider the poor,' and I have often--oh, so\nvery often--longed to go, but you were always so busy, dear papa, that\nyou never had time, you know,\" (the stiff man winced a little at this)\n\"but you seem to have more time now, papa, and although I'm too weak to\ngo with you, I thought I would ask you to go to see this poor fairy, and\ntell her I will go to see her some day--if--if God makes me strong\nagain.\"\n\nThe stiff man winced still more at this, but it was only a momentary\nwince, such as a man gives when he gets a sudden and severe twinge of\ntoothache.  It instantly passed away.  Still, as in the case of\ntoothache, it left behind an uneasy impression that there might be\nsomething very sharp and difficult to bear looming in the not distant\nfuture.\n\nMr Auberly had covered his face with his hand, and leant his elbow on\nthe head of the couch.  Looking up quickly with a smile--still tinged\nwith grimness, for evil habits and their results are not to be got rid\nof in a day--he said:\n\n\"_Well_, Loo, I will go to see this fairy if it will please you; but\nsomewhere near London Bridge is not a very definite address.\"\n\n\"Oh, but Willie Willders knows it,\" said Loo.\n\n\"But where is Willie Willders?\" objected her father.\n\n\"Perhaps at home; perhaps at Mr Tippet's place.\"\n\n\"Well, we shall soon find out,\" said Mr Auberly, rising and ringing the\nbell.\n\nHopkins answered the summons.\n\nStiff, thin, tall, sedate, powdered, superfine Hopkins, how different\nfrom the personage we saw but lately plunging like a maniac at the\nfire-bell!  Could it have been thee, Hopkins?  Is it possible that\nanything so spruce, dignified, almost stately, could have fallen so very\nlow?  We fear it is too true, for human nature not unfrequently\nfurnishes instances of tremendous contrast, just as material nature\nsometimes furnishes the spectacle of the serene summer sky being\nengulfed in the black thunderstorm!\n\n\"Hopkins!\" said Mr Auberly, handing him a slip of paper, \"go to this\naddress and ask for the boy William Willders; if he is there, bring him\nhere immediately; if not, find out where he is, search for him, and\nbring him here without delay.  Take a cab.\"\n\nHopkins folded the paper delicately with both his little fingers\nprojecting very much, as though they wished it to be distinctly\nunderstood that they had no connection whatever with the others, and\nwould not on any account assist the low-born and hard-working\nforefingers and thumbs in such menial employment.  Hopkins's nose\nappeared to be affected with something of the same spirit.  Then Hopkins\nbowed--that is to say, he broke across suddenly at the middle, causing\nhis stiff upper man to form an obtuse angle with his rigid legs for one\nmoment, recovered his perpendicular--and retired.\n\nOh!  Hopkins, how difficult to believe that thy back was once as round\nas a hoop, and thy legs bent at acute angles whilst thou didst lay\nviolent hands on--well, well; let bygones be bygones, and let us all, in\nkindness to thee, learn the song which says--\n\n  \"Teach, O teach me to forget.\"\n\nHailing a cab with the air of six emperors rolled into one, Hopkins\ndrove to Mr Tippet's residence, where he learned that Willie had gone\nhome, so he followed him up, and soon found himself at Notting Hill\nbefore the door of Mrs Willders' humble abode.  The door was opened by\nWillie himself, who stared in some surprise at the stately visitor.\n\n\"Is William Willders at 'ome?\" said Hopkins.\n\n\"I rather think he is,\" replied Willie, with a grin; \"who shall I say\ncalls on him--eh?  You'd better send up your card.\"\n\nHopkins frowned, but, being a good-natured man, he immediately smiled,\nand said he would walk in.\n\n\"I think,\" said Willie, interposing his small person in the way, \"that\nyou'd as well stop where you are, for there's a invalid in the\ndrawing-room, and all the other rooms is engaged 'cept the kitchen,\nwhich of course I could not show _you_ into.  Couldn't you deliver your\nmessage?  I could manage to carry it if it ain't too heavy.\"\n\nIn a state of uncertainty as to how far this was consistent with his\ndignity, Hopkins hesitated for a moment, but at length delivered his\nmessage, with which Willie returned to the parlour.\n\nHere, on the little sofa, lay the tall form of Frank Willders, arrayed\nin an old dressing-gown, and with one of his legs bandaged up and\nmotionless.  His face was pale, and he was suffering great pain, but a\nfree-and-easy smile was on his lips, for beside him sat a lady and a\nyoung girl, the latter of whom was afflicted with strong sympathy, but\nappeared afraid to show it.  Mrs Willders, with a stocking and\nknitting-wires in her hands, sat on a chair at the head of the bed,\nlooking anxious, but hopeful and mild.  An open Bible which lay on a\nsmall table at her side, showed how she had been engaged before the\nvisitors entered.\n\n\"My good sir,\" said the lady, with much earnestness of voice and manner,\n\"I assure you it grieves me to the heart to see you lying in this state,\nand I'm quite sure it grieves Emma too, and all your friends.  When I\nthink of the risks you run and the way you dash up these dreadful fire--\nfire--things--what-d'ye-call-ums.  What _do_ you call them?\"\n\n\"Fire-escapes, ma'am,\" answered Frank, with a smile.\n\n\"Ah, fire-escapes (how you ever come down them alive is a mystery to me,\nI'm sure!)  But as I was saying, it makes one shudder to think of; and--\nand--how does your leg feel _now_?\" said Miss Tippet, forgetting what\nshe had intended to say.\n\n\"Pretty well,\" replied Frank; \"the doctor tells me it has broken without\nsplintering, and that I'll be all right in a few weeks, and fit for duty\nagain.\"\n\n\"Fit for duty, young man!\" exclaimed Miss Tippet; \"do you mean to say\nthat you will return to your dreadful profession when you recover?  Have\nyou not received warning enough?\"\n\n\"Why, madam,\" said Frank, \"some one must look after the fires, you know,\nelse London would be in ashes in a few months; and I like the work.\"\n\n\"Like the work!\" cried Miss Tippet, in amazement; \"like to be almost\nsmoked to death, and burned alive, and tumbled off roofs, and get upset\noff what's-its-names, and fall down fire--fire--things, and break all\nyour legs and arms!\"\n\n\"Well--no, I don't like all that,\" said Frank, laughing; \"but I like the\nvigour and energy that are called forth in the work, and I like the\nobject of the work, which is to save life and property.  Why,\" exclaimed\nFrank enthusiastically, \"it has all the danger and excitement of a\nsoldier's life without the bloody work, and with better ends in view.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, Frank,\" said the peaceful Mrs Willders, \"you must not say\n\\`better ends,' because it is a great and glorious thing to defend one's\nnative land.\"\n\n\"A very just observation,\" said Miss Tippet, nodding approval.\n\n\"Why, mother, who would have expected to hear _you_ standing up for the\nred-coats in this fashion?\" said Frank.\n\n\"I stand up for the blue-jackets too,\" observed Mrs Willders meekly;\n\"they fight for their country as well.\"\n\n\"True, mother,\" rejoined Frank; \"but I did not refer to ultimate ends, I\nonly thought of the immediate results in connection with those engaged.\nThe warrior fights, and, in so doing, destroys life and property.  The\nfireman fights, and in doing so protects and preserves both.\"\n\n\"Hear! hear!\" interrupted Willie; \"but the copy-book says \\`Comparisons\nare _odiows_!' don't it?  Mother, here's a fathom and two inches or so\nof humanity as wants me to go with him to Mr Auberly.  I s'pose Frank\ncan get along without me for a little while--eh?\"\n\n\"Certainly, my son; why does he want you?\"\n\n\"Don't know.  P'raps he's goin' to offer to make me his secretary.  But\nyou don't seem at all alarmed at the prospect of my being carried off by\na flunkey.\"\n\n\"You'll come back, dearie, I doubt not.\"\n\n\"Don't you?  Oh, very well; then I'll just look after myself.  If I\ndon't return, I'll advertise myself in the _Times_.  Good-bye.\"\n\nWillie returned to the door and announced that he was ready to go.\n\n\"But where is William?\" asked Hopkins.\n\n\"Mister William Willders stands before you,\" said the boy, placing his\nhand on his heart and making a bow.  \"Come now, Long-legs,\" he added,\nseizing Hopkins by the arm and pushing him downstairs and into the cab.\nLeaping in after him he shut the door with a bang.  \"Now then, cabby,\nall right, Beverly Square, full split; sixpence extra if you do it\nwithin the half!\"\n\nAway they went, and in a few seconds were in the Mall driving at a\nrattling pace.\n\n\"See that house?\" asked Willie, so suddenly as to startle Hopkins, who\nwas quite overwhelmed by the vigour and energy of his young companion.\n\n\"Eh! which! the one with the porch before the door?\"\n\n\"No, no, stoopid! the old red-brick house with the limbs of a vine all\nover the front of it, and the skeleton of a Virginia creeper on the\nwall.\"\n\n\"Yes, I see it,\" said Hopkins, looking out.\n\n\"Ah, a friend o' mine lives there.  I'm on wisitin' terms there, I am.\nNow then, mind your eye, pump-handle,\" cried Willie; \"the turn's rather\nsharp--hallo!\"\n\nAs they swung round into the Bayswater Road the cab came in contact with\na butcher's cart, which, being the lighter vehicle, was nearly upset.\nNo serious damage resulted, however, and soon after they drew up at the\ndoor of the house next Mr Auberly's; for that gentleman still occupied\nthe residence of his friend.\n\n\"Master Willders,\" said Hopkins, ushering him into the presence of Mr\nAuberly, who still sat at the head of the couch.\n\nWillie nodded to Loo and then to her father.\n\n\"Boy,\" said the latter, beckoning Willie to approach, \"my daughter\nwishes me to go and visit a poor family near London Bridge.  She tells\nme you know their name and address.\"\n\n\"The fairy, you know,\" said Loo, explaining.\n\n\"Ah, the Cattleys,\" answered Willie.\n\n\"Yes,\" resumed Mr Auberly.  \"Will you conduct me to their abode?\"\n\nIn some surprise Willie said that he would be happy to do so, and then\nasked Loo how she did.\n\nWhile Mr Auberly was getting ready, Willie was permitted to converse\nwith Loo and Mrs Rose, who was summoned to attend her young mistress.\nPresently Mr Auberly returned, bade Mrs Rose be very careful of the\ninvalid, and then set off with Willie.\n\nAt first the boy felt somewhat awed by the remarkably upright figure\nthat stalked in silence at his side, but as they continued to thread\ntheir way through the streets he ventured to attempt a little\nconversation.\n\n\"Weather's improvin', sir,\" said Willie, looking up.  \"It is,\" replied\nMr Auberly, looking down in surprise at the boldness of his small\nguide.\n\n\"Good for the country, sir,\" observed Willie.\n\nMr Auberly, being utterly ignorant of rural matters, thought it best to\nsay nothing to this.\n\nWe may add that Willie knew just as little (or as much), and had only\nventured the remark because he had often heard it made in every possible\nvariety of weather, and thought that it would be a safe observation,\nreplete, for all he knew to the contrary, with hidden wisdom.\n\nThere was silence after this for some time.\n\n\"D'you know Mr Tippet well, sir?\" inquired Willie suddenly.\n\n\"Ye--yes; oh yes, I know him _pretty_ well.\"\n\n\"Ah, he's a first-rater,\" observed Willie, with a look of enthusiasm;\n\"you've no notion what a trump he is.  Did you hear ever of his noo\nmachine for makin' artificial butter?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mr Auberly, somewhat impatiently.\n\n\"Ah, it's a wonderful invention, that is, sir.\"\n\n\"Boy,\" said Mr Auberly, \"will you be so good as to walk behind me?\"\n\n\"Oh, _cer'nly_, sir,\" said Willie, with a profound bow, as he fell to\nthe rear.\n\nThey walked on in silence until they came to the vicinity of the\nMonument, when Mr Auberly turned round and asked Willie which way they\nwere to go now.\n\n\"Right back again,\" said Willie.\n\n\"How, boy; what do you mean?\"\n\n\"We've overshot the mark about half a mile, sir.  But, please, I thought\nyou must be wishin' to go somewhere else first, as you led the way.\"\n\n\"Lead the way, _now_, boy,\" said Mr Auberly, with a stern look.\n\nWillie obeyed, and in a few minutes they were groping in the dark\nregions underground which Mr Cattley and his family inhabited.  With\nsome difficulty they found the door, and stood in the presence of \"the\nfairy.\"\n\nThin though the fairy had been when Willie saw her last, she might have\nbeen called fat compared with the condition in which they now found her.\nShe appeared like a mere shadow, with a delicate skin thrown over it.\nA bad transparency would have been more substantial in appearance.  She\nlay alone on her lonely pallet with a farthing candle beside her, which\ncast a light sufficient only to make darkness visible.  Being near the\npoor invalid, it caused her large dark eyes to glitter in an awful\nmanner.\n\nWillie at once forgot his companion, and running up to the fairy, seized\nher hand, and asked her how she did.\n\n\"Pretty well, Willie.  It's kind of you to come and see me so often.\"\n\n\"Not a bit, Ziza; you know I like it; besides, I've only come to-day to\nshow a gentleman the way.\"\n\nHe pointed to Mr Auberly, who had stopped short in the doorway, but who\nnow advanced and sat down beside the invalid, and put to her several\nformal questions in a very stately and stiff manner, with a great\nassumption of patronage.  But it was evident that he was not accustomed\nto the duty of visiting the sick, and, like little boys and girls when\nthey sit down to write a letter, was very much at a loss what to say!\nHe began by asking the fairy about her complaint, and exhausted every\npoint that entered into his imagination in reference to that.  Then he\nquestioned her as to her circumstances; after which he told her that he\nhad been sent to see her by his daughter Louisa, who was herself very\nill, owing to the effects of a fire in his own house.\n\nAt this point the child became interested, and came to his relief by\nasking a great many eager and earnest questions about Loo.  She knew\nabout the fire in Beverly Square and its incidents, Willie having often\nrelated them to her during his visits; and she knew Mr Auberly by name,\nand was interested in him, but his frigid manner had repelled her, until\nhe spoke of Loo having sent him to see her.\n\n\"Oh, I've been so sorry about Miss Loo, sir,\" said Ziza, raising her\nlarge eyes full in Mr Auberly's face; \"I've heard of her, you know,\nfrom Willie, and when I've been lying all alone here for hours and hours\ntogether, I have wondered how she spent her time, and if there were kind\npeople about her to keep up her spirits.  It's so strange that she and I\nshould have been both hurt by a fire, an' both of us so different every\nway.  I _do_ hope she'll get better, sir.\"\n\nMr Auberly became suddenly much interested in the fairy, for just as\n\"love begets love,\" so does interest beget interest.  His feelings\nhaving been roused, his tongue was loosed, and forthwith he enjoyed a\ndelightful conversation with the intelligent child; not that there was\nany remarkable change as to the matter of what was spoken, but there was\na vast change in the manner of speaking it.\n\nWillie also chimed in now and then, and volunteered his opinions in a\nway that would have called forth a sharp rebuke from his patron half an\nhour before; but he was permitted to speak, even encouraged, now, for\nMr Auberly was being tickled pleasantly; he was having his feelings and\naffections roused in a way that he had never thought of or tried before;\nhe was gathering golden experiences that he had never stooped to touch\nbefore, although the mine had been under his feet all his life, and his\npath had been strewn with neglected nuggets from the cradle--fortunately\nnot, as yet, to the grave!  Ziza's Bible lay on the counterpane close to\nher wasted little hand.  While she was talking of Loo, with deep\nsympathy beaming out of her eyes and trembling in her tones, Mr Auberly\nlaid his hand inadvertently on it.  She observed the action, and said--\n\n\"Are you going to read and pray with me, sir?\"\n\nMr Auberly was taken very much aback indeed by this question.\n\n\"Well--no,\" said he, \"that is--if--fact, I have not brought my\nprayer-book with me; but--but--I will read to you if you wish it.\"\n\nSympathy was gone now; the fairy felt that, and, not clearly\nunderstanding why, wondered at it.  She thanked her visitor, however,\nand shut her eyes, while Mr Auberly opened the Bible and cleared his\nvoice.  His confusion was only momentary; still the idea that he could\nbe confused at all by two mere children in such a wretched cellar so\nnettled the worthy man, that he not only recovered his self-possession,\nbut read a chapter with all the solemn dignity of tone and manner that\nhe would have assumed had he been officiating in Saint Paul's or\nWestminster Abbey.  This was such a successful essay, and overawed his\nlittle congregation so terribly, that for a moment he thought of\nconcluding with the benediction; but, being uncertain whether he could\ngo correctly through it, he wisely refrained.\n\nThereafter he rose, and bade the fairy good-night.\n\n\"Your father does not return till late, I suppose?\" he said, while he\nheld her hand.\n\n\"No; it is morning generally before he gets away.  The pantomimes are\nhurting him, I fear, for he's not so active as he once was, and he says\nhe feels the falls very bad.\"\n\n\"Poor man!  It's very sad; but I suppose it's the usual way with that\nclass of men.  Well, goodnight again.\"\n\n\"Good-night, sir!\" responded the fairy, with a bright smile, \"and thank\nyou very much for your visit.  Good-night, Willie.\"\n\nWillie said good-night in such a sulky tone, and followed Mr Auberly to\nthe door with such a reckless swagger, that the fairy gazed after him in\nunutterable surprise.  After shutting the door with a bang, he suddenly\nopened it again, and said in a loud voice--\n\n\"I say, I'll get my wages day arter to-morrow.  I'll bring you a couple\no' bobs then.  It's all I can afford just now, for cigars are dear.  If\nyou're hard up for wittles in the meantime, just grin and bear it;\nyou'll not die, you know, you'll only get thinner.  I _have_ heard that\na bit o' boiled shoe-leather ain't a bad thing to keep one easy till\nrelief comes.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" exclaimed Mr Auberly in the distance, and bustling back as\nlie spoke; \"I quite forgot; how stupid of me!  I was directed by my\ndaughter to give you this.\"\n\nHe took a ten-pound note from his purse, and put it into the fairy's\nhand.\n\n\"This is from Louisa,\" he continued, \"and I may add that it is the\nsavings from her pocket-money.  I did not wish the dear child to part\nwith it, and said I would give it to you from myself; but she was so\nurgent, and seemed so distressed when I refused my consent, that I gave\nin; so you have to thank my daughter, not me.\"\n\nMr Auberly smiled and nodded as he turned to go, and there was really\nvery little grimness in the smile on this occasion--very little indeed!\nWillie also nodded with great violence and frequency; he likewise winked\nwith one eye, and otherwise sought to indicate that there were within\nhim sundry deep and not easily expressed thoughts and feelings, which\nwere, upon the whole, of a satisfactory nature.\n\nAs for the fairy, she never once smiled or thanked Mr Auberly, but\nsimply stared at him with her lustrous eyes open to their very widest,\nand she continued to stare at the door, as though she saw him through\nit, for some time after they were gone.  Then she turned suddenly to the\nwall, thanked God, and burst into tears--glad tears, such as only those\ncan weep who have unexpectedly found relief when their extremity was\ngreatest.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.\n\nA CHANGE IN FORTUNE.\n\nThere is nothing more surprising in regard to sublunary matters than the\nway in which unexpected events arise out of what may be called\nunintentional causes.\n\nWhen David Boone and his friend Gorman planned the insurance and\ndestruction of the toy shop and its contents, they no more expected that\nthe very first steps towards that end would result in the conversion of\na poor into a flourishing business, than they expected that the\nexpression of a wish would convert Poorthing Lane into Beverly Square;\nyet so it was.\n\nPoor David was rendered so desperate by his straits, and so anxious to\nescape from the crime into which his friend sought to plunge him, that\nhe meditated suicide; but, lacking the courage to accomplish this, he\nrelieved his feelings by carrying out the details of his business and\nthe preliminary steps of his plan, with the wild and reckless energy of\na maniac.  The more he thought of the meshes which Gorman had cast\naround him, the more did he regard escape impossible.  He therefore\nsought relief in action.  He not only talked to his neighbours (as per\nagreement) about his rapidly increasing business, but he made purchases\non a scale more extensive than he had ever before contemplated, even in\nhis dreams.  Being convinced that ruin, sooner or later, was his doom,\nhe indulged in the most extravagant excesses, with much of the feeling\nwhich prompts some seamen, when the ship is sinking, to break into the\nspirit room and spend the short remnant of life in jollity.  He\nexperienced a sort of savage delight in ordering right and left from\nwholesale dealers in town and country, and even went so far as to write\nto Germany for toys, using the name of a well-known London house which\nhad hitherto (and justly) believed him to be an honest man.  The result\nof this was that Poorthing Lane was besieged for some time by railway\nvans, and waggons so huge that apparently an inch more added to their\nbulk would have rendered their passage impossible.  Great deal boxes\nwere constantly being unpacked in front of Mr Boone's door, much to the\nannoyance of Miss Tippet, who could not imagine how it happened that her\nsedate and slow-going landlord had got such a sudden increase of\nbusiness.  Little did she think, poor lady, that this was the fuel with\nwhich it was intended to roast her alive!\n\nSome of the smaller accounts for goods thus purchased Boone paid at once\nwith the money furnished to him by Gorman, and thus got credit for being\na capitalist.  Others he deferred payment of until a more convenient\nseason.\n\nHis friend Gorman, who would not have bent the joint of his little\nfinger to have saved him from destruction, was so anxious to get up a\ngood appearance, for the sake of getting the insurance effected\nadvantageously, that he did his best to carry out his part of the plan,\nand, being a man of energy who in the paths of virtue might have risen\nto a high position among men, he succeeded beyond his expectation.\nCrowds of purchasers were sent by him to the shop of \"the celebrated\ntoy-man.\"  Some were mere decoy-ducks, who came and went (for a\nconsideration) pretty frequently, and only \"priced\" the goods.  Others\nwere genuine purchasers, and between the two they created so much\ntraffic in the toy-shop, that the multitude--so difficult to move by\nmere suasion, but so prone to follow blindly in the wake of a senseless\nrush, when once the rush takes place--began to move in the direction of\nthe toyshop, and shortly before Christmas the demand for toys was so\ngreat, that Boone had to engage two assistants to carry on the business,\nand even the lane itself began to feel the benefit of the sudden\nincrease of traffic.\n\nAll this was patent to the eyes of David Boone, but he was so\noverwhelmed with a sense of the guilt he was about to incur, and the\ndeception he was even then practising, that he regarded the whole affair\nas a hollow bubble, which would soon burst and leave nothing behind.\nEven the rapid increase of the credit-balance in his bank-book did not\naffect his opinion, for he was not much of a financier, and, knowing\nthat his transactions were founded on deception, he looked on the\nbalance as being deceptive also.\n\nNot so thought Gorman.  That wily individual perceived, to his\namazement, that things were taking a turn which had never been\ncontemplated, so he silently looked on and wondered, and chuckled and\nresolved to abide his time.\n\nAs prosperity flowed in upon him, David Boone became more insane--for\nhis condition of mind was little, if at all, short of temporary\ninsanity--and his proceedings became more eccentric than ever.  Among\nother things, he became suddenly smitten with a desire to advertise, and\nimmediately in the columns of the tapers appeared advertisements to the\neffect that \"The Celebrated Toy Emporium\" was to be found in Poorthing\nLane.  Finding that this increased his business considerably, he hit\nupon a plan of advertising which has been practised rather extensively\nof late years in London.  He sent out an army of boys with pots of\nwhitewash and brushes, with directions to print in rough but large\nlegible letters the words, \"Who's Boone?\" on all the blank walls of the\nmetropolis, and in the papers he answered the question by having printed\nunder the same title, \"Why, the manager of the Toy Emporium, to be sure,\nin Poorthing Lane.\"  He also advertised specially that he had in stock,\n\"an assortment of 500 golden-haired dolls from Germany, full-dressed,\nhalf-dressed, and naked.\"\n\nThis last was irresistible.  Thousands of young hearts beat high at the\nmere thought of such numbers--\"with _golden_ hair too!\" and dozens of\nmammas, and papas too, visited Poorthing Lane in consequence.\n\nIn course of time David Boone's eyes began to open to the fact that he\nwas rapidly making a fortune.\n\nIt was after the bustle of the Christmas season was over that he made\nthis discovery.  One of his new assistants, a young man named Lyall, was\nthe means of opening his employer's eyes to the truth.  Lyall was a\nclever accountant, and had been much surprised from the first that Boone\nkept no regular system of books.  At the end of the year he suggested\nthat it would be well to take stock and find out the state of the\nbusiness.  Boone agreed.  Lyall went to work, and in a short time the\nresult of his labours showed, that after all debts were paid, there\nwould remain a satisfactory credit-balance at the bank.\n\nOn the evening of the day on which this marvellous fact was impressed on\nBoone's mind, Gorman called, and found his friend rubbing his hands, and\nsmiling benignantly in the back room.\n\n\"You seem jolly,\" said Gorman, sitting down, as usual, by the fire, and\npulling out, as usual, the short pipe.  \"Business gittin' on well?\"\n\n\"It is,\" said Boone, standing with his back to the fire, and swaying\nhimself gently to and fro; \"things don't look so bad.  I can pay you the\narrears of rent now.\"\n\n\"Oh, can you?\" said Gorman.  \"Ah!\"\n\n\"Yes, and I'm in a position to pay you fifty pounds of the debt I owe\nyou besides,\" said Boone.\n\n\"And a bill at three months for the balance?\" inquired Gorman.\n\nNo, he could not venture to do that exactly, but he hoped to pay a\nfurther instalment before the end of three months.\n\n\"Humph!  How much may the profits be?\"\n\nBoone could not say precisely, not having had all his accounts squared,\nbut he believed they were considerable.\n\n\"I'll be bound they are,\" said Gorman with a growl; \"you won't want to\nset things alight now, I daresay.\"\n\n\"Well, I think it'll be as well to wait a bit, and let us make hay while\nthis sunshine goes on.\"\n\n\"Let _you_ make hay, you mean?\"\n\n\"Oh, as to that, the most of it will go to your stack for some time to\ncome, Gorman.\"\n\n\"H'm! and what about the insurance?\"\n\n\"Well, you know,\" observed Boone, \"it's of no use paying the premium for\nnothing.  As we don't mean to set the place alight, you know.\"\n\n\"Ay, but the life insurance, I mean,\" said Gorman.\n\nBoone laughed, and observed that he thought it best not to die just at\nthat particular time, whereupon Gorman laughed, too, and said he was\nabout right, and that it would be as well to delay both events in the\nmeantime; after saying which, he took his leave in better humour than\nusual, for Gorman was what men of his own stamp termed a \"deep file.\"\nHe saw into futurity--so he thought--a considerable way farther than\nmost men, and in the future of his own imagination he saw such a\npleasant picture that his amiable spirit was quite cheered by it.  He\nsaw David Boone making money so fast, that his goods might be insured at\na much larger amount; he saw him getting into fresh difficulties, of\ncourse, because such a business, on such a foundation, could not go on\nprosperously except under the most able management, and, even though it\ndid prosper in spite of improbabilities, he foresaw that there was an\namiable gentleman, much like himself, who would induce Boone to traffic\nbeyond his means, and when money was wanted, the same kind gentleman (he\nsaw that quite clearly) would come forward generously with a loan, for\nwhich he would only ask Boone to make over to him in security his two\npolicies of insurance--fire and life; after which--well, we need not go\non revealing the future as it appeared to Gorman's mental vision;\nsuffice it to say, that he saw upon the whole a prospect which gave him\ngreat satisfaction.\n\nThere were one or two things which he did not see, however, and which\nmight have modified his feelings considerably if he had seen them.  Of\nthese we shall say nothing at present.\n\nAs for David Boone; his heart rejoiced, for he, too, had visions of the\nfuture which charmed him.  He saw his debt to Gorman paid, and himself\nset free from the power of that amiable friend.  He saw a toyshop change\nits locality and its aspect.  He saw it transplanted into Regent Street,\nwith plate-glass windows, in which were displayed objects of marvellous\ningenuity and transcendent beauty.  One window especially exhibiting,\nnot a crowd, but, a very nation of wax-dolls with blue eyes and golden\nhair!  He saw, moreover, a very little old woman, lying in a bed, in an\nelegant and comfortable apartment, with a Bible beside her, and a\ncontented smile on her face.  This old lady resembled his own mother so\nstrongly, that all other prospects of the future faded from his view,\nand in the fulness of his heart and his success, he resolved then and\nthere to go home and present her with a gift on the strength of the\nprosperity at that time attained to.\n\nDavid was sorely perplexed as to what this gift ought to be.  He thought\nof a new silk gown at first; but the remembrance of the fact that his\nmother was bedridden banished this idea.  Owing to the same fact, new\nboots and gloves were inadmissible; but caps were not--happy thought!\nHe started off at once, and returned home with a cap so gay, voluminous,\nand imposing, that the old lady, unused though she was to mirth, laughed\nwith amusement, while she cried with joy, at this (not the first)\nevidence of her son's affection.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.\n\nCHANGES AND MYSTERIES.\n\nSeven years passed away.  During that period London revolved in its\nusual course, reproducing its annual number of events--its births,\ndeaths, and marriages; its plans, plots, and pleasures; its business,\nbustle, and bungle; its successes, sentiments, and sensations; its\nfacts, fancies, and failures--also its fires; which last had increased\nsteadily, until they reached the imposing number of about twelve hundred\nin the year.\n\nBut although that time elapsed, and many changes took place, for better\nor for worse, in all circles of society, there had not been much change\nin the relative positions of the actors in our tale; at least, not much\nthat was apparent.  Great alterations, however, had taken place in the\nphysical condition of some of them, as the sequel will show.\n\nOne bright morning in the spring-time of the year, a youth with the soft\ndown of early manhood on his lips and cheeks, paced slowly to and fro\nnear the margin of the pond in Kensington Gardens.\n\nBeing early, the spot was as complete a solitude as the backwoods of\nNorth America, and so thick was the foliage on the noble trees, that no\nglimpse of the surrounding city could be obtained in any direction.\nEverything that greeted eye and ear was characteristic of \"the woods,\"\neven to the swans, geese, ducks, and other water-fowl which sported on\nthe clear surface of the pond; while the noise of traffic in the mighty\nmetropolis was so subdued by distance as to resemble the deep-toned roar\nof a great cataract.  A stranger, rambling there for the first time\nwould have found it difficult to believe that he was surrounded on all\nsides by London!\n\nIt was one of those soul-stirring mornings in which Nature seems to\nsmile.  There was just enough of motion in the air to relieve the effect\nof what is called a dead calm.  The ripple on the water caught the sun's\nrays, and, breaking them up, scattered them about in a shower of\nfragmentary diamonds.  Fleecy-white clouds floated in the blue sky,\nsuggesting dreams of fairy-land, and scents of sprouting herbage filled\nthe nostrils, reminding one of the fast-approaching summer.\n\nThe youth who sauntered alone by the margin of the pond was broad of\nshoulder and stout of limb, though not unusually tall--not much above\nthe middle height.  His gait was easy, free--almost reckless--as though\nhe cared not a fig for anybody, high or low, rich or poor; yet his eye\nwas bright and his smile kindly, as though he cared for everybody--high,\nlow, rich, and poor.  He sauntered with his hands in the pockets of his\nshort coat, and whistled an operatic air in a low melodious tone.  He\nwas evidently waiting for someone; and, judging from his impatient\ngestures, someone who was resolved to keep him waiting.\n\nPresently, a female figure appeared in the far distance, on the broad\navenue that leads direct from the Serpentine.  She was young and\ngraceful in form; but she walked with a quick step, with her eyes\nlooking down, like one who regarded neither youth nor grace.  Curiously\nenough, this downcast look gave to her fair face a modest, captivating\ngrace, which is never seen to sit upon the lofty brow, or to circle\nround the elevated nose, of conscious beauty.\n\nThe youth at first paid no attention to her (she was not the \"someone\"\nfor whom he waited); but as she drew near, he became suddenly\ninterested, and threw himself in her way.  Just as she was about to\npass, she raised her eyes, started, blushed, and exclaimed:\n\n\"Mr Willders!\"\n\n\"Good morning, Miss Ward!\" said the youth, advancing with a smile, and\nholding out his hand; \"this is indeed an unexpected pleasure; I did not\nknow that you were addicted to early walking.\"\n\n\"I am indeed fond of early walking,\" replied Emma, with a smile; \"but I\ncannot say that it is so much pleasure as duty which brings me here.  I\nam a day-governess, and pass this pond every morning on my way to\nKensington, where the family in which I teach resides.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Willie, with that amount of emphasis which denotes\nmoderate surprise and solicits information.\n\nHe paused for a single moment; but, seeing that Emma did not intend to\nspeak of her own affairs, he added quickly:\n\n\"I am waiting for my brother Frank.  We arranged to meet here this\nmorning.  I hope that Miss Tippet is well?\"\n\n\"Quite well,\" replied Emma, with a blush, as she took a sudden interest\nin a large duck, which swam up to the edge of the pond at that moment,\nin the hope, no doubt, of obtaining food from her hand.  Its hopes were\ndisappointed, however, for Emma only called it a beautiful creature; and\nthen, turning somewhat abruptly to Willie, said, with a slight look of\nembarrassment, that she feared she should be late and must bid him\ngood-morning.\n\nWillie felt a good deal puzzled, and had he been the same Willie that we\nintroduced at the commencement of our tale, he would have told Emma his\nmind candidly, and asked her what was the matter; but Willie was a man\nnow, so he smiled, lifted his hat politely, and wished her good-morning.\n\nFive minutes later, Frank appeared in the distance and hurried forward.\nSeven years had added a little to the breadth of his shoulders, and the\nfirm self-possession of his step and look; but they had made no other\nperceptible impression on him.  There was, indeed, a deep scar on his\nright temple; but that was the result of accident, not of time.  Many a\nhairbreadth escape had he made during these seven years of fighting with\nthe flames, and often had his life been in imminent danger; but he was\nfortunate in having escaped, hitherto, with only a broken leg and a\nvariety of small cuts, scalds, and bruises.  The cut on his temple was\nthe severest, and most recent of these.  He had got it in a fall through\na second floor, which gave way under him as he was attempting to rescue\nan old bedridden man, who lay in an inner chamber.  Frank was carried\nout in a state of insensibility on the broad shoulders of his friend\nBaxmore, while Dale rescued the old man.\n\n\"How goes it, Frank?\" cried Willie, advancing and giving his brother's\nhand a warm shake; \"the cut head mending--eh?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's all right,\" replied Frank, with a smile, as they sauntered up\nand down by the margin of the pond; \"the headaches have left me now, I'm\nthankful to say, and the-doctor tells me it won't leave much of a mark.\"\n\n\"You don't need to care much if it does, for it's an honourable scar,\nand does not spoil your beauty, old boy.\"\n\n\"Well, Willie,\" said Frank, \"here I am at your request.  What have you\ngot to tell me; nothing serious, I hope?\"\n\nThe stalwart fireman looked earnestly into his brother's face, and\nexhibited more anxiety than there seemed to be any occasion for.\n\n\"No, nothing very serious.  It may be serious enough for all I know; but\nas far as my knowledge goes it's not bad enough to make you look so\nanxious.  Why, what's the matter with you?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Willie.  Perhaps my late accident has shaken my nerves a bit.\"\n\nWillie burst into a loud laugh, and said that it was so awfully absurd\nto hear a man like Frank talking of nerves at all that he could not help\nit.\n\n\"Well, but what _is_ the news you've got to tell me?\" resumed Frank.\n\"You're not going to be married, are you?\"\n\nFrank asked this with a look and expression so peculiar that Willie\nagain laughed and said that really he could not understand him at all;\nfor even suppose he had been going to be married, that was no reason why\nhe should take it so much to heart, as the expression on his face\nimplied he did.\n\n\"Perhaps not, Willie,\" said Frank with a quiet smile; \"but _that_ is not\nwhat you want to speak about, then?\"\n\n\"No, certainly not.\"\n\nFrank appeared relieved, and Willie, observing the appearance, said--\n\n\"Come, now, I really don't see why you should be so very much pleased to\nhear that.  I'm young, it is true, but I'm old enough, and I have a good\nbusiness, with brilliant prospects, and there appears to me no reason on\nearth why I should not marry if I felt so disposed.\"\n\n\"None in the world, Willie,\" said Frank, with some haste, \"but you tell\nme you are not thinking of that just now; so pray let's hear what you've\ngot to say.\"\n\n\"Oh! it's all very well in you, old Blazes, to change the subject in\nthat way, but I'm nettled at your implied objection to my getting\nmarried if I choose.  However, we won't quarrel over it, so here goes\nfor the point.\"\n\nWillie's bantering manner instantly left him.  He walked in silence for\na few seconds, as if he pondered what he had to say.\n\n\"There are two points which trouble me just now, Frank, and I want your\nopinion in regard to them.  The first is, Miss Tippet.  She is a small\npoint, no doubt, whether we regard her physically or mentally, but she\nis by no means a small point if we regard her socially, for the good\nthat that little woman does in a quiet, unobtrusive way is almost\nincredible.  D'ye know, Frank, I have a sort of triumphant feeling in\nregard to the sour, cynical folk of this world--whom it is so impossible\nto answer in their fallacious and sophistical arguments--when I reflect\nthat there is a day coming when the meek and lowly and unknown workers\nfor the sake of our Lord shall be singled out from the multitude, and\ntheir true place and position assigned them.  Miss Tippet will stand\nhigher, I believe, in the next world than she does in this.  Well, Miss\nTippet has been much out of sorts of late, mentally; and Mr Tippet, who\nis the kindest man alive, has been very anxious about her, and has\nbegged of me to try to counsel and comfort her.  Now, it is not an easy\nmatter to comply with this request, because, in the first place, Miss\nTippet does not want me to counsel or comfort her, so far as I know;\nand, in the second place, my motives for attempting to do so might be\nmisunderstood.\"\n\n\"How so?\" exclaimed Frank quickly.\n\n\"Well, you know, Miss Ward lives with her,\" said Willie, with a modest\nlook.\n\nThere was again something peculiar about Frank's expression and manner,\nas he said, \"Well, it would not signify much, I daresay, if people were\nto make remarks about you and Miss Ward, for you know it would not be\nmisconstruction after all.\"\n\n\"What mean you?\" asked Willie in surprise.\n\n\"You remember what you once said to me about your bosom being on fire,\"\npursued Frank.  \"I suppose the fire has not been got under yet, has it?\"\n\nWillie burst into a loud laugh.\n\n\"Why, Blazes, do you not know--?  But, no matter; we came here to talk\nof business; after that is done we can diverge to love.\"\n\nWillie paused here again for a few seconds and then resumed:\n\n\"You must know, Frank, that the cause of Miss Tippet's disturbance just\nnow is the strange conduct of her landlord, David Boone, who has been\ngoing on of late in a way that would justify his friends putting him in\nan asylum.  His business affairs are, I fear, in a bad way, and he not\nonly comes with excessive punctuality for Miss Tippet's rent, but he\nasks her for loans of money in a wild incoherent fashion, and favours\nher with cautions and warnings of a kind that are utterly\nincomprehensible.  Only the other night he came to her and asked if she\ndid not intend soon to visit some of her friends; and on being informed\nthat she did not, he went further and advised her to do so, saying that\nshe was looking very ill, and he feared she would certainly get into bad\nhealth if she did not.  In fact, he even said that he feared she would\ndie if she did not go to the country for a few weeks.  Now, all this\nwould be laughable, as being the eccentricity of a half-cracked fellow,\nif it were not that he exhibits such a desperate anxiety that his advice\nshould be followed, and even begged of the poor lady, with tears in his\neyes, to go to visit her friends.  What d'ye think of it, Frank?  I\nconfess myself utterly nonplussed.\"\n\n\"I don't know what to think,\" said Frank after a pause.  \"Either the man\nmust be mad, or he wishes to rob Miss Tippet's house in her absence.\"\n\nWillie admitted that the first supposition might be true, but he held\nstoutly that the second was impossible, for Boone was too honest for\nthat.  They conversed for some time on this point, and both came\nultimately to the conclusion that the thing was incomprehensible and\nmysterious, and that it ought to be watched and inquired into.  Willie,\nmoreover, said he would go and consult his friend Barret about it.\n\n\"You know Barret, Frank?\"\n\n\"No; but I have heard of him.\"\n\n\"Ah, he's a first-rate fellow--in one of the insurance offices--I forget\nwhich.  I came to know him when I first went to Mr Tippet's.  He lived\nthen in the floor below us with a drunken companion whom he was anxious\nto reclaim; but he found him so hard to manage that he at last left him,\nand went to live in Hampstead.  He and I became great friends when he\nlived under our workshop.  He got married two years ago, and I have not\nseen much of him since, but he's a sharp fellow, and knows a good deal\nmore of the Tippets than I was aware of.  I'll go and see if he can\nthrow any light on this subject.\"\n\n\"The next point,\" pursued Willie, \"is Cattley the clown.  Have you seen\nor heard of him lately?\"\n\nFrank said he had not.\n\n\"Well, I am greatly troubled about him.  He has become a regular\ndrunkard, and leads his poor daughter a terrible life.  He is so broken\ndown with dissipation that he can scarcely procure employment anywhere.\nHis son is fortunately a pretty decent fellow, though somewhat wild, and\nhelps in a small way to support his father, having obtained a situation\nas clown at one of the minor theatres.  The daughter, Ziza, has long ago\ngiven up the profession, and has been struggling to maintain herself and\nher father by painting fire-screens, and making artificial flowers; but\nthe work is severe and ill paid, and I see quite well that if the poor\ngirl is not relieved in some way she will not be able to bear up.\"\n\n\"I grieve to hear this, Willie,\" said Frank, \"but how comes it that you\ntake so great an interest in these people?\"\n\n\"Frank,\" said Willie, assuming a tone of deep seriousness, while a glow\nsuffused his cheeks, \"can you keep a secret?\"\n\n\"I think so, lad; at least I promise to try.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Willie, \"I love Ziza Cattley.  I knew her first as a\nfairy, I know her now as a woman who is worthy of a place among the\nangels, for none but those who know her well and have seen her fighting\nthe battle of life can have the least idea of the self-denial, the\nperseverance under difficulties, the sweetness of temper, and the\ndeep-seated love of that devoted girl.  She goes every night, after the\ntoil of each day, to the door of the theatre, where she waits to conduct\nher father safely past the gin-palaces, into which, but for her, he\nwould infallibly stray, and she spends all she has in making him\ncomfortable, but I see well enough that this is killing her.  She can't\nstand it long, and I won't stand it at all!  I've made up my mind to\nthat.  Now, Frank, I want your advice.\"\n\nTo say that Frank was hearty in his assurances that he would do what he\ncould to help his brother, would be a faint way of stating the truth.\nFrank shook Willie by the hand and congratulated him on having gained\nthe affections of one whom he knew to be a good girl, and then condoled\nwith him on that girl's unfortunate circumstances; but Willie stopped\nhim short at this point by asking him in a tone of surprise what could\nbe the matter with him, for at first he had been apparently annoyed at\nthe notion of his (Willie's) being in love, and now he seemed quite\npleased about it.  In short, his conduct was unaccountable!\n\nFrank laughed, but said eagerly--\n\n\"Why.  Willie, did you not tell me long ago that there was a fire in\nyour bosom, lit up by a certain young friend of Miss Tippet's--\"\n\n\"Oh,\" interrupted Willie, \"Emma Ward; ah, yes, I confess that I did feel\nspooney once in that direction when I was a boy, but the fairy displaced\nher long ago.  No, no, Frank, I'm not accountable for boyish fancies.\nBy the way, I have just parted from the fair Emma.  We had a\n_tete-a-tete_ here not half an hour before you arrived.\"\n\n\"Here!\" exclaimed Frank in surprise.\n\n\"Ay, here,\" repeated Willie; \"she passes this pond every morning, she\ntold me, on her way to teach a family in Kensington; by the way, I\ndidn't think of asking whether the father, mother, and servants were\nincluded among her pupils.  Why, Frank, what an absent frame of mind you\nare in this morning!  I declare it is not worth a man's while consulting\nyou about anything.\"\n\n\"I beg pardon,\" cried Frank quickly, \"your words caused my mind to\nwander a bit.  Come, what do you think of doing?\"\n\n\"What do you think I should do? that is the question.\"\n\n\"You can offer to assist them,\" suggested Frank.  \"I've done so,\" said\nthe other, \"but Ziza won't accept of assistance.\"\n\n\"Could we not manage to get her a situation of some sort with light work\nand good pay?\"\n\n\"Ah! a fireman's, for instance,\" cried Willie, with a sarcastic laugh;\n\"did you ever hear of a situation with light work and good pay except\nunder Government?  _I_ never did; but we might perhaps find _steady_\nwork and good pay.  It would only be required for a time, because I mean\nto--ah, well, no matter--but how and where is it to be got?  Good Mr\nTippet is of no use, because he is mad.\"\n\n\"Mad, Willie!\"\n\n\"Ay, mad as a March hare.  For years back I have suspected it, but now,\nI am sure of it; in fact I feel that I have gradually come to be his\nkeeper--but more of that anon.  Meanwhile, what is to be done for the\nCattleys?\"\n\n\"Could nothing be done with Mr Auberly?\"\n\nWillie shook his head.\n\n\"No, I fear not.  He was in a soft state once--long ago--six or seven\nyears now, I think--when the dear fairy was ill and he seemed as if he\nwere going to become a man; but his daughter Loo had just begun to be\nill at that time.  She's been so long ill now that he has got used to\nit, and has relapsed again into an oyster.\"\n\n\"He might be reached through Loo yet,\" said Frank.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" replied Willie, \"but I doubt it, for he's a blunt old fellow\nin his feelings, however sharp he may be in his business; besides, Loo\nis so weak now that very few are allowed to see her except Ziza, and\nMiss Tippet, and Emma Ward.\"\n\nThe brothers remained silent after this for some time, for neither of\nthem could see his way out of their difficulties; at last Frank\nsuggested that Willie should go home and consult his mother.\n\n\"She is wise, Willie, and has never given us bad advice yet.\"\n\n\"I know what her first advice will be,\" said Willie.\n\n\"What?\" asked Frank.\n\n\"To go and pray about it,\" answered Willie.\n\n\"Well, she might give worse advice than that,\" said Frank, with much\nearnestness.  \"In fact, I doubt if she could give better.\"\n\n\"True,\" assented Willie, \"and now, old fellow, I'm off.  Mr Tippet\nlikes punctuality.  I'll look in at the station in passing if anything\nturns up to clear my mind on these matters; meanwhile good-bye.\"\n\nIt is a remarkable fact that Frank Willders took an early walk, as\nfrequently as possible, in Kensington Gardens, near the pond, after this\nconversation with his brother, and it is a still more remarkable fact,\nthat he always felt like a guilty man on these occasions, as if he were\ntaking some mean advantage of some one; yet it was certain that he took\nadvantage of no one, for nobody ever met him there by any chance\nwhatever!  A fact even more remarkable still was, that never, after that\nday, did Emma Ward go to her duties through Kensington Gardens, but\nalways by the Bayswater Road, although the latter was dusty and\nunpicturesque compared with the former; and it is a circumstance worthy\nof note, as savouring a little of mystery, that Emma acted as if she too\nwere a guilty creature during her morning walks, and glanced uneasily\nfrom side to side as she went along, expecting, apparently, that a\npoliceman or a detective would pounce upon her suddenly and bear her off\nto prison.  But, whether guilty or not guilty, it is plain that no\npoliceman or detective had the heart to do it, for Miss Ward went on her\nmission daily without molestation.\n\nIt is not easy to say what was the cause of these unaccountable\nproceedings.  We might hazard an opinion, but we feel that our duty is\naccomplished when we have simply recorded them.  Perhaps love had\nsomething to do with them--perhaps not--who knows?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY SIX.\n\nWHAT DRINK WILL DO.\n\nTime passed on, as time is wont to do, and Christmas came again.  The\nsnow was deep in London streets and thick on the roofs and chimneys.  It\ncurled over the eaves of the houses in heavy white folds ready to fall\nand smother the unwary passengers.  It capped the railings everywhere\nwith little white knobs, and rounded off the corners of things so, that\nwherever the eye alighted, the same impressions were invariably conveyed\nto it, namely, whiteness and rotundity.  Corinthian capitals were\nrendered, if possible, more ornate than ever by snow; equestrian statues\nwere laden with it so heavily, that the horses appeared to stagger\nbeneath their trappings and the riders, having white tips to their\nnoses, white lumps on their heads and shoulders, and white patches on\ntheir cheek-bones and chins, looked ineffably ridiculous, and miserably\ncold.  Everything, in fact, was covered and blocked up with snow, and\nLondoners felt as if they had muffled drums in their ears.\n\nIt was morning.  The sky was clear, the air still, and the smoke of\nchimneys perpendicular.  Poulterers' shops were in their holiday attire;\ntoy-shops were in the ascendant, and all other shops were gayer than\nusual.  So were the people who thronged the streets and beat their hands\nand stamped their feet--for it was unusually cold.\n\nStreet boys were particularly lively, and chaff was flying as thickly as\nsnow-flakes had fallen the night before.  Even the roughs--who forsook\ntheir dens, and, with shovels and brooms on their shoulders, paraded the\nstreets, intent on clearing door-steps with or without the leave of\ninhabitants--seemed to be less gruff than usual, and some of them even\nwent the length of cutting jokes with the cabmen and the boys.  Perhaps\ntheir spirits were elevated by the proud consciousness of being for once\nin the way of earning an honest penny!\n\n\"I say, Ned,\" observed one of these roughs (a lively one), who was very\nrough indeed, to a companion, who was rougher still and gloomy, \"look at\nthat there gal cleanin' of her steps with a fire-shovel!  Ain't that\neconomy gone mad?  Hallo, young 'ooman, what's the use o' trying to do\nit with a teaspoon, when there's Ned and me ready to do it with our\nshovels for next to nothin'?\"\n\nThe servant-girl declined the assistance thus liberally offered, so the\ntwo men moved slowly on, looking from side to side as they went, in\nexpectation of employment, while a small boy, in a man's hat, who walked\nbehind them, nodded to the girl, and said she was a \"sensible thrifty\ngal,\" and that she might be sure there was \"some feller unknown who\nwould bless the day he was born after he'd got her.\"\n\nFifty yards farther on, a stout, red-faced, elderly gentleman was\nobserved to look out at the street door and frown at things in general.\n\n\"Have your door-steps cleaned, sir?\" asked the lively rough, taking the\nshovel off his shoulder.\n\nThe elderly gentleman being angry, on private and unknown grounds\n(perhaps bad digestion), vouchsafed no reply, but looked up at the sky\nand then over the way.\n\n\"Do it cheap, sir,\" said the lively rough.\n\n\"No!\" said the elderly gentleman, with a sort of snapping look, as he\nturned his gaze up the street and then down it.\n\n\"Snow's wery deep on the steps, sir,\" said the rough.\n\n\"D'you suppose I'm an ass?\" exclaimed the elderly gentleman, in a sudden\nburst.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said the lively rough, in the grave tone and manner of one\nwho has had a difficult question in philosophy put to him, \"well, sir, I\ndon't know about that.\"\n\nHis large mouth expanded gradually from ear to ear after this reply.\nThe elderly gentleman's face became scarlet and his nose purple, and\nretreating two paces, he slammed the door violently in the rough's face.\n\n\"Ah, it all comes of over-feedin', poor feller,\" said the lively man,\nshouldering his shovel and resuming his walk beside his gloomy comrade,\nwho neither smiled nor frowned at these pleasantries.\n\n\"A warm old g'n'l'm'n!\" remarked the boy in the man's hat as he passed.\n\nThe lively man nodded and winked.\n\n\"Might eat his wittles raw an' cook 'em inside a'most!\" continued the\nboy; \"would advise him to keep out of 'yde Park, though, for fear he'd\ngit too near the powder-magazine!\"\n\nAt this point the gloomy rough--who did not appear, however, to be a\ngenuine rough, but a pretty good imitation of one, made of material that\nhad once seen better days--stopped, and said to his comrade that he was\ntired of that sort of work, and would bid him good-day.  Without waiting\nfor an answer he walked away, and his companion, without vouchsafing a\nreply, looked after him with a sneer.\n\n\"A rum cove!\" he remarked to the small boy in the man's hat, as he\ncontinued his progress.\n\n\"Rayther,\" replied the boy.\n\nWith this interchange of sentiment these casual acquaintances parted, to\nmeet probably no more!\n\nMeanwhile the gloomy rough, whom the lively one had called Ned, walked\nwith rapid steps along several streets, as though he had a distinct\npurpose in view.  He turned at last into a narrow, quiet street, and\ngoing up to the door of a shabby-genteel house, applied the knocker with\nconsiderable vigour.\n\n\"Now then, go along with you; we don't want _your_ services here; we\nclear off our own snow, we do.  Imprence! to knock, too, as if he was a\ngentleman!\"\n\nThis was uttered by a servant-girl who had thrust her head out of a\nsecond-floor window to take an observation of the visitor before going\ndown to open the door.\n\n\"Is he at home, Betsy dear?\" inquired the gloomy man, looking up with a\nleer which proved that he could be the reverse of gloomy when he chose.\n\n\"Oh, it's you, is it?  I don't think he wants to see you; indeed, I'm\nsure of it,\" said the girl.\n\n\"Yes he does, dear; at all events I want to see him; and, Betsy, say\nit's pressing business, and _not_ beggin'.\"\n\nBetsy disappeared, and soon after, reappearing at the door, admitted the\nman, whom she ushered into a small apartment, which was redolent of\ntobacco, and in which sat a young man slippered and dressing-gowned,\ntaking breakfast.\n\n\"How are you, doctor?\" said the visitor, in a tone that did not accord\nwith his soiled and ragged garments, as he laid down his hat and shovel,\nand flung himself into a chair.\n\n\"None the better for seeing you, Hooper,\" replied the doctor sternly.\n\n\"Well, well!\" exclaimed Ned, \"what a world we live in, to be sure!  It\nwas \\`Hail fellow! well met,' when I was well off; now,\" (he scowled\nhere) \"my old familiars give me the cold shoulder _because I'm poor_.\"\n\n\"You know that you are unjust,\" said the doctor, leaning back in his\nchair, and speaking less sternly though not less firmly; \"you know, Ned,\nthat I have helped you with advice and with money to the utmost extent\nof my means, and you know that it was a long, long time before I ceased\nto call you one of my friends; but I do not choose to be annoyed by a\nman who has deliberately cast himself to the dogs, whose companions are\nthe lowest wretches in London, and whose appearance is dirty and\ndisgusting as well as disreputable.\"\n\n\"I can't help it,\" pleaded Hooper; \"I can get no work.\"\n\n\"I don't wonder at that,\" replied the doctor; every friend you ever had\nhas got you work of one kind or another during the last few years, and\nyou have drunk yourself out of it every time.  Do you imagine that your\nfriends will continue to care for a man who cares not for himself?\n\nNed did not reply, but hung his head in moody silence.\n\n\"Now,\" continued the doctor, \"my time is a little more valuable than\nyours; state what you have got to say, and then be off.  Stay,\" he\nadded, in a softened tone, \"have you breakfasted?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Ned, with a hungry glance at the table.\n\n\"Well, then, as you did not come to beg, you may draw in your chair and\ngo to work.\"\n\nNed at once availed himself of this permission, and his spirits revived\nwonderfully as he progressed with the meal, during which he stated the\ncause of his visit.\n\n\"The fact is,\" said he, \"that I want your assistance, doctor--\"\n\n\"I told you already,\" interrupted the other, \"that I have assisted you\nto the utmost extent of my means.\"\n\n\"My good fellow, not so sharp, pray,\" said Ned, helping himself to\nanother roll, the first having vanished like a morning cloud; \"I don't\nwant money--ah: that is to say, I _do_ want money, but I don't want\nyours.  No; I came here to ask you to help me to get a body.\"\n\n\"A body.  What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Why, what I say; surely you've cut up enough of 'em to know 'em by\nname; a dead body, doctor,--a subject.\"\n\nThe doctor smiled.\n\n\"That's a strange request, Ned.  You're not going to turn to my\nprofession as a last resort, I hope?\"\n\n\"No, not exactly; but a friend of mine wants a body--that's all, and\noffers to pay me a good round sum if I get one for him.\"\n\n\"Is your friend a medical man?\" asked the doctor.\n\n\"N-no, he's not.  In fact, he has more to do with spirits than bodies;\nbut he wants one of the latter--and I said I'd try to get him one--so,\nif you can help me, do so, like a good fellow.  My friend is particular,\nhowever; he wants a _man_ one, above six feet, thin and sallow, and with\nlong black hair.\"\n\n\"You don't suppose I keep a stock of assorted subjects on hand, do you?\"\nsaid the doctor.  \"I fear it won't be easy to get what you want.  Do you\nknow what your friend intends to do with it?\"\n\n\"Not I, and I don't care,\" said Ned, pouring out another cup of coffee.\n\"What does a body cost?\"\n\n\"Between two and three pounds,\" replied the doctor.\n\n\"Dear me, so cheap,\" said Ned, with a look of surprise; \"then that\nknocks on the head a little plan I had.  I thought of offering myself\nfor sale at Guy's or one of the hospitals, and drinking myself to death\nwith the money, leaving my address, so that they might know where to\nfind me; but it's not worth while to do it for so little; in fact, I\ndon't believe I could accomplish it on three pounds' worth of\ndissipation.\"\n\n\"Don't jest about your besetting sin,\" said the doctor gravely; \"it's\nbad enough without that.\"\n\n\"Bad enough,\" exclaimed Ned, with a sudden flash of ferocity; \"ay, bad\nenough in all conscience, and the worst of it is, that it makes me ready\nto jest about _anything_--in heaven, earth, or hell.  Oh, drink!\naccursed drink!\"\n\nHe started up and clutched the hair of his head with both hands for a\nmoment; but the feeling passed away, and he sat down again and resumed\nbreakfast, while he said in a graver tone than he had yet used--\n\n\"Excuse me, doctor; I'm subject to these bursts now and then.  Well,\nwhat say you about the body?  My friend offers me twenty pounds, if I\nget the right kind.  That would be seventeen pounds of profit on the\ntransaction.  It's worth an effort.  It might put me in the way of\nmaking one more stand.\"\n\nNed said this sadly, for he had made so many stands in time past, and\nfailed to retain his position, that hope was at dead low-water of a very\nneap-tide now.\n\n\"I don't like the look of the thing,\" said the doctor.  \"There's too\nmuch secrecy about it for me.  Why don't your friend speak out like a\nman; state what he wants it for, and get it in the regular way?\"\n\n\"It mayn't be a secret, for all I know,\" said Ned Hooper, as he\nconcluded his repast.  \"I did not take the trouble to ask him; because I\ndidn't care.  You might help me in this, doctor.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll put you in the way of getting what you want,\" said the\ndoctor, after a few moments reflection; \"but you must manage it\nyourself.  I'll not act personally in such an affair; and let me advise\nyou to make sure that you are not getting into a scrape before you take\nany steps in the matter.  Meanwhile, I must wish you good-day.  Call\nhere again to-night, at six.\"\n\nThe doctor rose as he spoke, and accompanied Ned to the door.  He left a\ncoin of some sort in his palm, when he shook hands.\n\n\"Thankee,\" said Ned.\n\n\"If you had come to beg, you should not have got it,\" said the doctor.\n\"God help him!\" he added as he shut the door; \"it is an awful sight to\nsee an old companion fall so low.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN.\n\nAN OLD PLOT.\n\nIt is evening now.  The snow is still on the ground; but it looks ruddy\nand warm in the streets, because of the blaze of light from the\nshop-windows, and it looks colder than it did on the house-tops, by\nreason of the moon which sails in the wintry sky.\n\nThe man in the moon must have been in good spirits that night, for his\nresidence seemed almost fuller than the usual full moon, and decidedly\nbrighter--to many, at least, of the inhabitants of London.  It looked\nparticularly bright to Miss Tippet, as she gazed at it through the\nwindows of her upper rooms, and awaited the arrival of \"a few friends\"\nto tea.  Miss Tippet's heart was animated with feelings of love to God\nand man; and she had that day, in obedience to the Divine precept,\nattempted and accomplished a good many little things, all of which were,\neither directly or indirectly, calculated to make human beings happy.\n\nEmma Ward, too, thought the moon particularly bright that night; in fact\nshe might almost have been regarded as a lunatic; so steadily did she\ngaze at the moon, and smile to herself without any apparent motive.\nThere was reason for her joy, however, for she had come to know, in some\nmysterious way, that Frank Willders loved her; and she had known, for a\nlong time past, that she loved Frank Willders.\n\nFrank had become a foreman of the Fire Brigade, and had been removed\nfrom his former station and comrades to his new charge in the city.  But\nFrank had not only risen in his profession; he had also risen\nintellectually.  His mother had secured to him a pretty good education\nto begin with, and his own natural taste and studious habits had led him\nto read extensively.  His business required him to sit up and watch when\nother men slept.  He seldom went to bed before four o'clock any morning,\nand when he did take his rest he lay down like the soldier in an enemy's\ncountry, ready to rush to arms at the first sound of the bugle.  His\nbugle, by the way, was a speaking-trumpet, one end of which was close to\nthe head of his bed, the other end being in the lobby where the men on\nduty for the night reposed.\n\nDuring these long watches in the silent lobby, with the two men belted\nand booted on their tressels, the clock ticking gently by his side, like\nthe soft quiet voice of a chatty but not tiresome friend, Frank read\nbook after book with absorbing interest.  History, poetry, travel,\nromance--all kinds were equally devoured.  At the particular time of\nwhich we write, however, he read more of poetry than of anything else.\n\nThe consequence was that Frank, who was one of nature's gentlemen,\nbecame a well-informed man, and might have moved in any circle of\nsociety with credit to himself, and profit as well as pleasure to\nothers.\n\nFrank was by nature grave, sedate, earnest, thoughtful.  Emma was\nequally earnest--more so perhaps--but she was light-hearted (not light\n_headed_, observe) and volatile.  The result was mutual attraction.  Let\nphilosophers account for the mutual attraction of these qualities as\nthey best may, we simply record the fact.  History records it; nature\nrecords it; experience--everything records it; who has the temerity, or\nfolly, to deny it?\n\nEmma and Frank _felt_ it, and, in some mysterious way, Frank had come to\nknow something or other about Emma's feelings, which it is not our\nbusiness to inquire into too particularly.\n\nSo, then, Frank also gazed--no, not at the moon; it would have required\nhim to ascend three flights of stairs, and a ladder, besides passing\nthrough a trap to the roof of the station, to enable him to do that; but\nthere was a lamp over the fireplace, with a tin reflector, which had\nquite a dazzling effect of its own--not a bad imitation of the moon in a\nsmall way--so he gazed at that, and thought it very bright indeed;\nbrighter than usual.\n\nWe may as well put the reader out of suspense at once by saying that we\ndo not intend to describe Miss Tippet's evening with \"a few friends.\"\nOur own private opinion in regard to the matter is, that if they had\nbeen fewer than they were, and more worthy of the name of friends, the\nevening might have been worth recording, but it is sufficient to say\nthat they all came; acted as usual, spoke as usual, felt as usual,\n\"favoured the company\" with songs, as usual, and--ah--yes--enjoyed\nthemselves as usual till about half-past eleven o'clock, when they all\ntook their leave, with the exception of Miss Deemas, who, in\nconsideration of the coldness of the weather, had agreed to spend the\nnight with her \"dear friend.\"\n\nMiss Deemas was one of those unfortunates with whom it is impossible for\nany one to sleep.  Besides being angular and hard, she had a habit of\nkicking in her slumbers, and, being powerful, was a dangerous bedfellow.\nShe knew this herself, and therefore wisely preferred, when visiting\nher friends, to sleep alone.  Hence it happened that Miss Tippet and\nEmma went to bed in the back room with the green hangings, while Miss\nDeemas retired to the front room with the blue paper.\n\nThere is a common fallacy in naval matters founded on poetical license,\nto the effect that the mariner is separated from death by a single\nplank; whereas, the unpoetical truth is, that the separation consists of\nmany hundreds of planks, and a solid bulwark of timbers more than a foot\nthick, besides an inner \"skin,\" the whole being held together by\ninnumerable iron and oaken bolts and trenails, and tightened with oakum\nand pitch.  We had almost fallen into this error--or poetical laxity of\nexpression--by saying that, on the night of which we write, little did\nMiss Tippet know that she was separated from, not death exactly, but\nfrom something very awful, by a single plank; at least, by the floor of\nher own residence, and the ceiling of the house below--as the sequel\nwill show.\n\nThat same night, David Boone, gaunt, tall, and cadaverous as of old, sat\nin his back parlour, talking with his friend Gorman.\n\n\"Now, Boone,\" said the latter, with an oath, \"I'm not goin' to hang off\nand on any longer.  It's more than seven years since we planned this\nbusiness, the insurances have been effected, you've bin a prosperous\nman, yet here you are, deeper in my debt than ever.\"\n\n\"Quite true,\" replied Boone, whose face was so pale that he might have\neasily been mistaken for a ghost, \"but you know I have paid up my\npremiums quite regular, and your interest too, besides clearin' off some\nof the principal.  Come, don't be hard on me, Gorman.  If it had not\nbeen that trade has got worse of late, I would have cleared off all I\nowe you, but indeed, indeed I have not been so successful of late, and\nI'm again in difficulties.  If you will only wait--\"\n\n\"No,\" cried Gorman, \"I'll not wait.  I have waited long enough.  How\nlong would you have me wait--eh?  Moreover, I'm not hard on you.  I show\nyou an easy way to make a good thing of it, and you're so\nchicken-hearted that you're afraid to do it.\"\n\n\"It's such a mean thing to do,\" said Boone.\n\n\"Mean!  Why, what do you call the style of carrying on business that you\nstarted with seven years ago, and have practised more or less ever\nsince?\"\n\n\"That is mean, too,\" said Boone; \"I'm ashamed of it; sorry for it.  It\nwas for a time successful no doubt, and I have actually paid off all my\ncreditors except yourself, but I don't think it the less mean on that\naccount, and I'm thoroughly ashamed of it.\"\n\nThere was a good deal of firmness in Boone's tone as he said this, and\nhis companion was silent for a few minutes.\n\n\"I have arranged,\" he said at last, \"about your making over your\npolicies of insurance to me as security for the debt you owe me.  You\nwon't have to pay them next half-year, I'll do that for you _if\nnecessary_.\"  He laughed as he said this.  \"I have now come to ask you\nto set the house alight, and have the plan carried out, and the whole\naffair comfortably settled.\"\n\nGorman said this in an encouraging voice, assuming that his dupe was\nready to act.\n\n\"B-but it's awful to think of,\" said Boone; \"suppose it's found out?\"\n\n\"How can it be found out?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know.  It's wonderful how crime is discovered,\" said\nBoone despondingly; \"besides, think of the risk we run of burning the\npeople who live above, as well as my two clerks who sleep in the room\nbelow us; that would be murder, you know.  I'm sure I have tried my very\nbest to get Miss Tippet to go from home for a short time, I've almost\nlet the cat out of the bag in my anxiety, but she won't take the hint.\"\n\n\"Oho!\" exclaimed Gorman, with a laugh.\n\n\"Well, have you made the arrangements as I directed you last night?\"\n\n\"Yes, I've got a lot of tarry oakum scattered about, and there is a pile\nof shavings,\" he added, pointing to a corner of the room; \"the only\nthing I'm anxious about is that my young man Robert Roddy caught me\npouring turpentine on the walls and floor of the shop.  I pretended that\nit was water I had in the can, and that I was sprinkling it to lay the\ndust before sweeping up.  Roddy is a slow, stupid youth; he always was,\nand, I daresay, did not notice the smell.\"\n\nGorman was himself filled with anxiety on hearing the first part of\nthis, but at the conclusion he appeared relieved.\n\n\"It's lucky you turned it off so,\" said he, \"and Roddy _is_ a stupid\nfellow.  I daresay he has no suspicion.  In fact, I am sure of it.\"\n\n\"It's not of much importance _now_, however,\" said Boone, rising and\nconfronting his friend with more firmness than he had ever before\nexhibited to him, \"because I have resolved _not to do it_.\"\n\nGorman lit his pipe at the fire, looking at the bowl of it with a\nscornful smile as he replied--\n\n\"Oh! you have made up your mind, have you?\"\n\n\"Yes, decidedly.  Nothing will move me.  You may do your worst.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" remarked Gorman, advancing with the lighted paper towards\nthe heap of shavings.\n\nBoone sprang towards him, and, seizing his arms, grasped the light and\ncrushed it out.\n\n\"What would you do, madman?\" he cried.  \"You can only ruin me, but do\nyou not know that I will have the power to denounce you as a\nfire-raiser?\"\n\nGorman laughed, and returned to the fireplace, while Boone sat down on a\nchair almost overcome with terror.\n\n\"What! you dare to defy me?\" said Gorman, with an air of assumed pity.\n\"A pretty case you would have to make out of it.  You fill your shop\nwith combustibles, you warn your tenant upstairs to get out of the\npremises for a time in a way that must be quite unaccountable to her\n(until the fire accounts for it), and your own clerk sees you spilling\nturpentine about the place the day before the fire occurs, and yet you\nhave the stupidity to suppose that people will believe you when you\ndenounce _me_!\"\n\nPoor David Boone's wits seemed to be sharpened by his despair, for he\nsaid suddenly, after a short pause--\n\n\"If the case is so bad it will tell against yourself, Gorman, for I\nshall be certainly convicted, and the insurance will not be paid to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Ay, but the case is not so bad as it looks,\" said Gorman, \"if you only\nhave the sense to hold your tongue and do what you are told; for nobody\nknows all these things but you and me, and nobody can put them together\nexcept ourselves--d'ye see?\"\n\n\"It matters not,\" said Boone firmly; \"I _won't_ do it--there!\"\n\nBoth men leaped up.  At the same moment there was a sound as of\nsomething falling in the shop.  They looked at each other.\n\n\"Go see what it is,\" said Gorman.\n\nThe other stepped to the door.\n\n\"It's only two of my wax-dolls tumbled off the shelf,\" he said on\nreturning.\n\nAn exclamation of horror escaped him, for he saw that the heap of\nshavings had been set on fire during his momentary absence, and Gorman\nstood watching them with a demoniacal grin.\n\nBoone was struck dumb.  He could not move or speak.  He made a feeble\neffort to stretch out his hands as if to extinguish the fire, but Gorman\nseized him in his powerful grasp and held him fast.  In a few seconds\nthe flames were leaping up the walls, and the room was so full of smoke\nthat they were driven into the front shop.\n\n\"Now, then,\" said Gorman in a fierce whisper, \"your _only_ chance is to\nact out your part as wisely as you can.  Shout _fire_! now till you're\nblack in the face--fire!  _Fire_!!  FIRE!!!\"\n\nDavid Boone obeyed with all his might, and, when Gorman released him,\nran back into the parlour to try to extinguish the flames, but he was\ndriven back again, scorched and half-choked, while Gorman ran off at\nfull speed to the nearest station, gave the alarm, received the shilling\nreward for being first to give the call, and then went leisurely home to\nbed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT.\n\nAT THE POST OF DUTY.\n\nFire!  There is something appalling in the cry to most ears; something\ndeadly in the sound; something that tells of imminent danger and urgent\nhaste.  After David Boone's first alarm was given, other voices took it\nup; passers-by became suddenly wild, darted about spasmodically and\nshouted it; late sitters-up flung open their windows and proclaimed it;\nsleepers awoke crying, \"What! where?\" and, huddling on their clothes,\nrushed out to look at it; little boys yelled it; frantic females\nscreamed it, and in a few minutes the hubbub in Poorthing Lane swelled\ninto a steady roar.\n\nAmong the sound sleepers in that region was Miss Deemas.  The fair head\nof that lady reposed on its soft pillow all unconscious of the fact that\nshe was even then being gently smoked before being roasted alive.\n\nMiss Tippet, on the very first note of alarm, bounced out of bed with an\nemphatic \"There!\" which was meant to announce the triumphant fulfilment\nof an old prophecy which she had been in the habit of making for some\ntime past; namely, that Matty Merryon would certainly set the house on\nfire if she did not take care!\n\nThe energy with which Miss Tippet sprang to the floor and exclaimed\n\"There!\" caused Emma Ward to open her eyes to the utmost possible\nextent, and exclaim, \"Where?\"\n\nWithout waiting for a reply she too bounded out of bed like an\nindiarubber ball, and seeing (for there was always a night-light in the\nroom) that Miss Tippet's face was as white as her night-dress, she\nattempted to shriek, but failed, owing to a lump of some kind that had\ngot somehow into her throat, and which refused to be swallowed on any\nterms.\n\nThe repetition of the cry, \"Fire! fire!\" outside, induced both ladies at\nonce to become insane.  Miss Tippet, with a touch of method even in her\nmadness, seized the counterpane, wrapped it round her, and rushed out of\nthe room and downstairs.  Emma followed her example with a blanket, and\nalso fled, just as Matty Merryon, who slept in an attic room above,\ntumbled down her wooden staircase and burst into the room by another\ndoor, uttering a wild exclamation that was choked in the bud partly by\nterror, partly by smoke.  Attempting in vain to wrap herself in a\nbolster, Matty followed her mistress.  All three had utterly forgotten\nthe existence of Miss Deemas.  That strong-minded lady being, as we have\nhinted, a sound sleeper, was not awakened by the commotion in the\nstreet.  In fact, she was above such weaknesses.  Becoming aware of a\ncrackling sound and a sensation of smoke, she smiled sweetly in her\nslumbers, and, turning gently on her other side, with a sigh, dreamed\nardently of fried ham and eggs--her usual breakfast.\n\nWhile these events were occurring the cry of fire had reached the ears\nof one of London's guardians; our friend Samuel Forest.  That\nstout-hearted man was seated at the time rapping the sides of his\nsentry-box with his head, in a useless struggle with sleep.  He had just\nsuccumbed, and was snoring out his allegiance to the great conqueror,\nwhen the policeman on the beat dashed open his door and shouted \"Fire!\"\n\nSam was a calm, self-possessed man.  He was no more flurried by this\nsudden, unexpected, and fierce shout of \"Fire,\" than he would have been\nif the policeman had in a mild voice made a statement of water.  But,\nalthough self-possessed and cool, Sam was not slow.  With one energetic\neffort he tripped up and floored the conqueror with one hand, as it\nwere, while he put on his black helmet with the other, and in three\nminutes more the fire-escape was seen coming up the lane like a rampant\nmonster of the antediluvian period.\n\nIt was received by the crowd with frantic cheers, because they had just\nbecome aware that a lady was asleep in one of the upper rooms, which\nwere by that time unapproachable, owing to the lower part of the\nstaircase having caught fire.\n\nThe fact was made known with a sudden look of horror by Miss Tippet,\nwho, with Emma Ward, had been rescued from the first-floor window by a\ngallant policeman.  This man, having procured a ladder, entered the\nhouse at considerable personal risk, and carried the ladies out in\nsafety, one after the other; an event, we may remark in passing, which\nis not of rare occurrence at London fires, where the police are noted\nfor their efficient services and for the daring of some of the members\nof the force, many of whom have received medals and other rewards for\nacts of personal daring in attempting to save life before the firemen\nhad arrived on the ground.\n\nHaving put Miss Tippet and Emma in a place of security, the policeman\nwas about to make a desperate attempt to reach the upper floor by\nrushing through the flames, when the escape came up and rendered it\nunnecessary.\n\nDozens of tongues and hundreds of voices directed Sam Forest to the\nright window.  He pointed his escape towards it, but so vigorous was the\nuninvited assistance lent by the crowd that the head of the machine went\ncrashing through it and dashed the frame into the middle of the room.\n\nTo say that Miss Deemas was horror-struck by such an awakening would be\nto use a mild expression.  Her strong mind was not strong enough to\nprevent her strong body from trembling like an aspen leaf, as she lay\nfor a few moments unable to cry or move.  Suddenly she believed that she\nwas dreaming, and that the instrument which had burst through her window\nwas a nightmare or a guillotine, and she made dreadful efforts to pinch\nherself awake without success.  Next moment a man's head, looking very\ngrim in the light of a bull's-eye lamp, appeared at the top of the\nguillotine.  So far this was in keeping with her idea; but when the head\nleapt into the room, followed by its relative body, and made a rush at\nher, Miss Deemas cast courage and philosophy to the dogs, gave herself\nover to abject fear, uttered a piercing shriek, dipped her head under\nthe bedclothes, and, drawing her knees up to her mouth, clasped her\nhands over them in agony.\n\n\"Come, ma'am, don't take on so; no time to lose; floor's goin' down!\"\nsaid Sam.  He coughed as he said it, for the smoke was getting thicker\nevery moment.\n\nShriek upon shriek was the only answer vouchsafed by the terrified\nEagle.  A wild cheer from the mob outside seemed to be a reply of\nencouragement to her; but it was not so; it was called forth by the\nsudden appearance of a fire-engine dashing round the corner of the lane.\n\n\"Be quiet, my good lady,\" said Sam Forest in a voice of tenderness; but\nif his voice was tender his actions were the reverse, for it was now a\nmatter of life or death; so he grasped the Eagle, bedclothes and all, in\nhis arms, and bore her to the window.\n\nIt is probable that this act revived in Miss Deemas some reminiscences\nof her childhood, for she suddenly straightened herself out and\nstruggled violently, after the manner of those sweet little ones who\n_won't_ be made to sit on nurse's knees.  Being a tall, heavy woman, she\nstruggled out of Sam's grasp and fell to the floor; but her victory was\nshort-lived.  Another moment and that bold man had her round the waist,\nin a grasp from which she could not free herself.  Sam was considerate,\nhowever, and polite even in this extremity.  He begged pardon as he\nwrapped the bedclothes round his victim, and lifting her into the head\nof the escape, let her go.\n\nNo swoop that the Eagle ever made (mentally) down upon base, unworthy,\narrogant man, was at all comparable to the descent which she made\n(physically) on that occasion into the arms of an expectant fireman!\nShe held her breath, also the blankets, tightly, as she went down like a\nlightning-flash, and felt that she was about to be dashed to pieces, but\nto her surprise soft cushions received her, and she was immediately\nborne, by another of these desperate men in helmets, into an adjoining\nhouse, and left unhurt in the arms of her sympathetic friend Miss\nTippet.\n\n\"Oh, my dear, _dear_ Julia!\" exclaimed Miss Tippet, shutting the door of\nthe room into which they had been ushered, and assisting her friend to\ndisentangle herself from the bedclothes.  \"Oh! what a mercy we've not\nall been roasted alive like beef steaks--or--oh! _what_ a sight you are,\nmy darling!  You must have got it coming down that dreadful thing--the\nwhat's-'is-name, you know.  Shall I ring for water?\"\n\n\"Tut, nonsense!\" exclaimed the Eagle, panting as well from nervous\nexcitement as exhaustion; \"you are always so fussy, Emelina.  Please\nassist me to tie this string, Miss Ward.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know I'm fussy, dear Julia!\" exclaimed Miss Tippet, bustling\nnervously about the room; \"but I can't help it, and I'm so thankful\nfor--; but it was so bold in these noble fellows to risk their lives\nto--\"\n\n\"Noble fellows!\" shouted Miss Deemas, with flashing eyes, \"d'you call it\nnoble to pull me out of bed, and roll me in a blanket and shoot me down\na--a--I don't know what, like a sack of coals?  Noble fellows, indeed!\nBrutes!\"\n\nHere Miss Deemas clasped her hands above her head in a passion of\nconflicting feelings, and, being unable to find words for utterance,\nburst into a flood of tears, dropped into a chair, and covered her face\nwith both hands.\n\n\"Dear, dear, _darling_ Julia!\" said Miss Tippet soothingly.\n\n\"Don't speak to me!\" sobbed the Eagle passionately, and stamping her\nfoot; \"I can't bear to think of it.\"\n\n\"But you know, dear,\" persevered her friend, \"they could not help\nbeing--being--what d'you call it?--energetic, you know, for it was not\nrough.  We should all have been roasted to death but for them, and I\nfeel very, _very_ grateful to them.  I shall respect that policeman as\nlong as I live.\"\n\n\"Ah, sure an' he _is_ a dacent boy now,\" said Matty Merryon, who entered\nthe room just then; \"the way he lifted you an' Miss Emma up an' flung ye\nover his showlder, as aisy as if ye was two bolsters, was beautiful to\nlook at; indade it was.  Shure it remimbered me o' the purty pottery ye\nwas readin' just the other night, as was writ by O'Dood or O'Hood--\"\n\n\"Hood,\" suggested Miss Tippet.\n\n\"P'r'aps it was,\" said Matty; \"he'd be none the worse of an O before his\nname anyhow.  But the pottery begood with--\\`Take her up tinderly, lift\nher with care,' if I don't misremimber.\"\n\n\"_Will_ you hold your tongue!\" cried the Eagle, looking up suddenly and\ndrying her eyes.\n\n\"Surely, miss,\" said Matty, with a toss of her head; \"anything to plaize\nye.\"\n\nIt is due to Matty to say that, while the policeman was descending the\nladder with her mistress, she had faithfully remained to comfort and\nencourage Emma; and after Emma was rescued she had quietly descended the\nladder without assistance, having previously found time to clothe\nherself in something a little more ample and appropriate than a bolster.\n\nBut where was David Boone all this time?  Rather say, where was he not?\nEverywhere by turns, and nowhere long, was David to be seen, in the\nfrenzy of his excitement.  Conscience-smitten, for what he had done, or\nrather intended to do, he ran wildly about, making the most desperate\nefforts to extinguish the fire.\n\nNo one knows what he can do till he is tried.  That is a proverb (at\nleast if it is not it ought to be) which embraces much deep truth.  The\nway in which David Boone set personal danger at defiance, and seemed to\nregard suffocation by smoke or roasting by fire as terminations of life\nworth courting, was astounding, and rendered his friends and neighbours\ndumb with amazement.\n\nDavid was now on the staircase among the firemen, fighting his way up\nthrough fire and smoke, for the purpose of saving Miss Tippet, until he\nwas hauled forcibly back by Dale or Baxmore--who were in the thick of it\nas usual.  Anon, down in the basement, knee-deep in water, searching for\nthe bodies of his two shopmen, both of whom were standing comfortably\noutside, looking on.  Presently he was on the leads of the adjoining\nhouse, directing, commanding, exhorting, entreating, the firemen there\nto point their branch at the \"blue bedroom.\"  Soon after he was in the\nstreet, tearing his hair, shouting that it was all his fault; that he\ndid it, and that it would kill him.\n\nBefore the fire was put out, poor Boone's eyelashes and whiskers were\nsinged off; little hair was left on his head, and that little was short\nand frizzled.  His clothes, of course, were completely soaked; in\naddition to which, they were torn almost to shreds, and some of his skin\nwas in the same condition.  At last he had to be forcibly taken in\ncharge, and kept shut up in an adjoining house, from the window of which\nhe watched the destruction of his property and his hopes.\n\nAlmost superhuman efforts had been made by the firemen to save the\nhouse.  Many a house in London had they saved that year, partially or\nwholly; as, indeed, is the case every year, and many thousands of\npounds' worth of property had they rescued; but this case utterly defied\nthem.  So well had the plot been laid; so thoroughly had the\ncombustibles been distributed and lubricated with inflammable liquids,\nthat all the engines in the metropolis would have failed to extinguish\nthat fire.\n\nDavid Boone knew this, and he groaned in spirit.  The firemen knew it\nnot, and they worked like heroes.\n\nThere was a shout at last among the firemen to \"look out!\"  It was\nfeared one of the partition walls was coming down, so each man beat a\nhasty retreat.  They swarmed out at the door like bees, and were all\nsafe when the wall fell--all safe, but one, Joe Corney, who, being a\nreckless man, took things too leisurely, and was knocked down by the\nfalling bricks.\n\nMoxey and Williams ran back, and carried him out of danger.  Then,\nseeing that he did not recover consciousness, although he breathed, they\ncarried him at once to the hospital.  The flames of the burning house\nsprang up, just then, as if they leaped in triumph over a fallen foe;\nbut the polished surface of poor Joe's helmet seemed to flash back\ndefiance at the flames as they bore him away.\n\nAfter the partition wall fell, the fire sank, and in the course of a few\nhours it was extinguished altogether.  But nothing whatever was saved,\nand the firemen had only the satisfaction of knowing that they had done\ntheir best, and had preserved the adjoining houses, which would\ncertainly have gone, but for their untiring energy.\n\nBy this time, David Boone, besides being mad, was in a raging fever.\nThe tenant of the house to which he had been taken was a friend, as well\nas a neighbour of his own--a greengrocer, named Mrs Craw, and she\nturned out to be a good Samaritan, for she insisted on keeping Boone in\nher house, and nursing him; asserting stoutly, and with a very red face\n(she almost always asserted things stoutly, and with a red face), that\nMister Boone was one of 'er best an' holdest friends, as she wouldn't\nsee 'im go to a hospital on charity--which she despised, so she did--as\nlong as there was a spare bed in her 'ouse, so there was--which it\nwasn't as long as could be wished, considerin' Mister Boone's height;\nbut that could be put right by knocking out the foot-board, and two\ncheers, so it could--and as long she had one copper to rub on another;\nno, though she was to be flayed alive for her hospitality.  By which\nround statement, Mrs Craw was understood to imply a severe rebuke to\nMrs Grab--another greengrocer over the way (and a widow)--who had been\nheard to say, during the progress of the fire, that it served Boone\nright, and that she wouldn't give him a helping hand in his distress on\nany account whatever.\n\nWhy Mrs Grab was so bitter and Mrs Craw so humane is a matter of\nuncertainty; but it was generally believed that the former having had a\nmatrimonial eye on Boone, and that Boone having expressed general\nobjections to matrimony--besides having gone of late to Mrs Craw for\nhis vegetables--had something to do with it.\n\nNext day, D. Gorman happened, quite in a casual way of course, to\nsaunter into Poorthing Lane; and it was positively interesting to note--\nas many people did note--the surprise and consternation with which he\nreceived the news of the fire from the people at the end of the lane who\nfirst met him, and who knew him well.\n\n\"Wery sad, ain't it, sir?\" said a sympathetic barber.  \"He was sitch a\ndroll dog too.  He'll be quite a loss to the neighbourhood; won't he,\nsir?\"\n\n\"I hope he won't,\" said Gorman, loud enough to be heard by several\npersons who lounged about their doors.  \"I hope to see him start afresh,\nan' git on better than ever, poor fellow; at least, I'll do all _I_ can\nto help him.\"\n\n\"Ah! you've helped him already, sir, more than once, I believe; at least\nso he told me,\" said the barber, with an approving nod.\n\n\"Well, so I have,\" returned Gorman modestly, \"but he may be assured that\nany trifle he owes me won't be called for just now.  In fact, my small\nloan to him is an old debt, which I might have got any time these last\nsix years, when he was flourishing; so I'm not going to press him now,\npoor fellow.  He's ill, you say?\"\n\n\"Yes, so I'm told; raither serious too.\"\n\n\"That's very sad; where is he?\"\n\n\"With Mrs Craw, sir, the greengrocer.\"\n\n\"Ah, I'll go and see him.  Good-day.\"\n\nGorman passed on, with as much benignity thrown into his countenance as\nit could contain; and the barber observed, as he re-entered his shop,\nthat, \"that man was a better fellow than he looked.\"\n\nBut Gorman's intentions, whatever they might have been, were frustrated\nat that time; for he found Boone in high fever, and quite delirious.  He\ndid not, however, quit the house without putting, as he expressed it, at\nleast one spoke in his wheel; for he conducted himself in such a way\ntowards Mrs Craw, and expressed so much feeling for her friend \"and\nhis,\" that he made quite a favourable impression on that worthy woman.\nHe also left a sovereign, wherewith to purchase any little luxuries for\nthe sick man, that might be conducive to his health and comfort, and\nwent away with the assurance that he would look in to inquire for him as\noften as he could.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY NINE.\n\nWILLIE WILLDERS IN DIFFICULTIES.\n\nMr Thomas Tippet, beaming and perspiring as of old, was standing at his\nbench, chisel in hand, and Willie Willders was standing with his back to\nthe fire, and his legs pretty wide apart; not because he preferred that\n_degage_ attitude, but because Chips and Puss were asleep side by side\nbetween his feet.\n\nIt must not be supposed that although Willie had changed so much since\nthe first day he stood there, an equal change had taken place in Mr\nTippet.  By no means.  He was a little stouter, perhaps, but in all\nother respects he was the same man.  Not a hair greyer, nor a wrinkle\nmore.\n\nThe workshop, too, was in exactly the same state, only a little more\ncrowded in consequence of numerous models having been completed and\nshelved during the last seven years.  There was, however something new\nin the shape of a desk with some half-finished plans upon it; for Willie\nhad gradually introduced a little genuine engineering into the business.\n\nAt first, naturally enough, the boy had followed his employer's lead,\nand, as we have said before, being very ingenious, as well as\nenthusiastic, had entered with all his heart and head into the absurd\nschemes of his patron; but as he became older he grew wiser.  He applied\nhimself to reading and study at home in the evenings with indomitable\nperseverance.\n\nThe result of his application was twofold.  In the first place he\ndiscovered that he was very ignorant and that there existed a huge\nillimitable field of knowledge worth entering on seriously.  His early\ntraining having been conducted (thanks to his mother) \"in the fear of\nthe Lord,\" he regarded things that are spiritual, and have God and man's\nduty to Him for their object, as part--the chief part--of that great\nfield of knowledge; not as a separate field which may or may not be\nentered on according to taste.  In the second place, he began to\ndiscover that his kind-hearted employer was a monomaniac.  In other\nwords, that, although sane enough in all other matters, he was\nabsolutely mad in regard to mechanical discoveries and inventions, and\nthat most of the latter were absolutely nonsensical.\n\nThis second discovery induced him to prosecute his studies with all the\nmore energy, in order that he might be prepared for the battle of life,\nin case his existing connection with Mr Tippet should be dissolved.\n\nHis studies naturally took an engineering turn, and, being what is\ntermed a thorough-going fellow, he did not rest until he had dived into\nmathematics so deep that we do not pretend to follow him, even in the\nway of description.  Architecture, surveying, shipbuilding, and cognate\nsubjects, claimed and obtained his earnest attention; and year after\nyear, on winter nights, did he sit at the side of the fire in the little\nhouse at Notting Hill, adding to his stores of knowledge on these\nsubjects; while his meek old mother sat darning socks or patching male\nattire on the other side of the fire with full as much perseverance and\nassiduity.  One consequence of this was that Willie Willders, having\nbegun as a Jack-of-all trades, pushed on until he became a\nphilosopher-of-all-trades, and of many sciences too, so that it would\nhave been difficult to find his match between Charing Cross and Primrose\nHill.\n\nAnd Willie was not changeable.  True to his first love, he clung with\nall the ardour of youth to fire, fire-engines, and the fire-brigade.  He\nwould have become a member of the latter if he could, but that was in\nthe circumstances impossible.  He studied the subject, however, and knew\nits history and its working details from first to last.  He did his best\nto invent new engines and improve on old ones; but in such matters he\nusually found that his inventions had been invented, and his\nimprovements made and improved upon, long before.  Such checks, however,\ndid not abate his ardour one jot.  He persevered in his varied courses\nuntil he worked himself into a species of business which could exist\nonly in London, which it would be difficult to describe, and which its\npractitioner styled \"poly-artism\" with as much boldness as if the word\nwere in Johnson's Dictionary!\n\nStanding on the hearth, as we have said, Willie related to his friend\nall he knew in regard to the Cattley family, and wound up with an\nanxious demand what was to be done for them.\n\nMr Tippet, leaning on his bench and looking into Willie's face with a\nbenignant smile, said--\n\n\"Done, my boy? why, help 'em of course.\"\n\n\"Ay, but how?\" asked Willie.\n\n\"How?\" cried Mr Tippet; \"why, by giving 'em money.  You are aware that\nI stopped their allowance because Cattley senior went and drank it as\nsoon as he got it, and Cattley junior is able to support himself, and I\nwas not until now aware that the poor daughter was killing herself to\nsupport her father; but as I do know it now I'll continue the allowance\nand increase it, and we shall give it into the daughter's hands, so that\nthe father won't be able to mis-spend it.\"\n\nMr Tippet's visage glowed with ardour as he stated this arrangement,\nbut the glow was displaced by a look of anxiety as he observed that\nWillie shook his head and looked as perplexed as ever.\n\n\"If that plan would have availed I would have tried it long ago,\" said\nhe, with a sad smile, \"for my income is a pretty good one, thanks to\nyou, sir--\"\n\n\"Thanks to your own genius, Willie, for the remarkable and prolific\noffshoots which you have caused to sprout from this dry old root,\" said\nMr Tippet, interrupting, as he glanced round the room with an air of\naffection, which showed that he loved the root dearly, despite its age\nand dryness.\n\n\"Not the less thanks to you, sir,\" said Willie, in the deferential tone\nwhich he had assumed involuntarily towards his patron almost from the\ncommencement of their intercourse; \"but Z---a--Miss Cattley positively\nrefuses to accept of money from anyone in charity, as long as she can\nwork.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Mr Tippet, shaking his head slowly, \"pride, simple\npride.  Not laudable pride, observe.  She deceives herself, no doubt,\ninto the belief that it is laudable, but it is not; for, when a girl\ncannot work without working herself into her grave, it is her duty _not_\nto work, and it is the duty as well as the privilege of her friends to\nsupport her.  Truth is truth, Willie, and we must not shrink from\nstating it because a few illogical thinkers are apt to misunderstand it,\nor because there are a number of mean-spirited wretches who would be too\nglad to say that they could not work without injuring their health if\nthey could, by so doing, persuade their friends to support them.  What!\nare those whom God has visited with weakness of body to be made to toil\nand moil far beyond their strength in order to prove that they do not\nbelong to the class of deceivers and sycophants?  Yet public opinion in\nregard to this matter of what is called self-respect and proper pride\ncompels many hundreds who urgently require assistance to refuse it, and\ndooms many of them to a premature grave, while it does not shut the maw\nof a single one of the other class.  Why, sir, Miss Cattley is\ncommitting suicide; and, in regard to her father, who is dependent on\nher, she is committing murder--murder, sir!\"\n\nMr Tippet's eyes flashed with indignation, and he drove the chisel deep\ndown into the bench, as if to give point and force to his sentiment, as\nwell as an illustration of the dreadful idea with which he concluded.\n\nWillie admitted that there was much truth in Mr Tippet's observations,\nbut did not quite agree with him in his sweeping condemnation of Ziza.\n\n\"However,\" continued Mr Tippet, resuming his quiet tone and benignant\naspect, \"I'll consider the matter.  Yes, I'll consider the matter and\nsee what's to be done for 'em.\"\n\nHe leaped from the bench with a quiet chuckle as he said this and began\nto saw vigorously, while Willie went to his desk in the corner and\napplied himself to an abstruse calculation, considerably relieved in\nmind, for he had unbounded belief in the fertility of Mr Tippet's\nimagination, and he knew well that whatever that old gentleman promised\nhe would certainly fulfil.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY.\n\nTHE BEST-LAID PLANS.\n\nThere were other men besides Mr Tippet who could be true to their\npromises when it suited them.\n\nD. Gorman was true to his, in so far as they concerned David Boone.  He\nvisited that unfortunate invalid so frequently, and brought him so many\nlittle \"nice things\" for the alleviation of his sufferings, and\nexhibited altogether such nervous anxiety about his recovery, that\nworthy Mrs Craw was quite overwhelmed, and said, in the fulness of her\nheart, that she never did see a kinder friend, or one who more flatly\ngave the lie-direct to his looks, which, she was bound to admit, were\nnot prepossessing.\n\nBut, despite his friend's solicitude, and his doctor's prescriptions,\nand his nurse's kindness, David Boone continued steadily to sink, until\nat last the doctor gave it as his opinion that he would not recover.\n\nOne afternoon, soon after the expression of this opinion, Gorman called\non his friend, and was shown as usual into his chamber.  It was a wet,\ncold, stormy afternoon, and the window rattled violently in its frame.\n\nBoone was much better that afternoon.  It seemed as if he had just\nwaited for the doctor to pronounce his unfavourable opinion in order to\nhave the satisfaction of contradicting it.\n\n\"He's better to-day, sir,\" said Mrs Craw, in a whisper.\n\n\"Better!\" exclaimed Gorman with a look of surprise, \"I'm glad to hear\nthat--very glad.\"\n\nHe looked as if he were very sorry, but then, as Mrs Craw said, his\nlooks belied him.\n\n\"He's asleep now, sir; the doctor said if he slept he was on no account\nto be waked up, so I'll leave you to sit by him, sir, till he wakes,\nand, please, be as quiet as you can.\"\n\nMrs Craw left the room on tip-toe, and Gorman went to the bedside and\nlooked on the sick man's wasted features with a frown.\n\n\"Ha! you're asleep, are you, and not to be waked up--eh?  Come, I'll\nrouse you.\"\n\nHe shook him violently by the shoulder, and Boone awoke with a start and\na groan.\n\n\"Hope I didn't disturb you, Boone,\" said his friend in a quiet voice.\n\"I came to inquire for you.\"\n\nBoone started up in his bed and stared wildly at some object which\nappeared to be at the foot of the bed.  Gorman started too, and turned\npale as his eyes followed those of the invalid.\n\n\"What is it you see, Boone?\"\n\n\"There, there!\" he whispered hoarsely, clutching Gorman's arm as if for\nprotection, \"look, I heard his voice just now; oh! save me from that\nman; he--he--wants to kill me!\"\n\n\"Come, David,\" said Gorman soothingly, \"it's only a fancy--there's\nnobody there--nobody in the room but me.\"\n\n\"And who are you?\" inquired the sick man, falling back exhausted, while\nhe gazed vacantly at his friend.\n\n\"Don't you know me, David?\"\n\n\"Never mind, shut your eyes now and try to sleep.  It'll be time to take\nyour physic soon.\"\n\n\"Physic!\" cried Boone, starting up in alarm, and again clutching\nGorman's arm.  \"You won't let _him_ give it me, will you?  Oh! say you\nwon't--promise to give it me yourself!\"\n\nGorman promised, and a very slight but peculiar smile turned up the\ncorners of his mouth as he did so.\n\nBoone again sank back on his pillow, and Gorman sat down on a chair\nbeside him.  His villainous features worked convulsively, for in his\nheart he was meditating a terrible deed.  That morning he had been\nvisited by Ned Hooper, who in the most drunken of voices told him, \"that\nit wash 'mposh'ble to git a body f'r love or munny, so if 'e wanted one\nhe'd better cut's own throat.\"\n\nHis plans having miscarried in this matter, Gorman now meditated taking\nanother and more decided step.  He looked at the sick man, and, seeing\nhow feeble he was, his fingers twitched as if with a desire to strangle\nhim.  So strong was the feeling upon him that he passed his fingers\nnervously about his own throat, as if to ascertain the formation of it\nand the precise locality of the windpipe.  Then his hand dropped to his\nside, and he sat still again, while Boone rolled his poor head from side\nto side and moaned softly.\n\nEvening drew on apace, and the shadows in the sick-room gradually became\ndeeper and deeper until nothing could be seen distinctly.  Still Gorman\nsat there, with his features pale as death, and his fingers moving\nnervously; and still the sick man lay and rolled his head from side to\nside on the pillow.  Once or twice Gorman rose abruptly, but he as often\nsat down again without doing anything.\n\nSuddenly a ray of bright light shot through the window.  Gorman started\nand drew back in alarm.  It was only a lamp-lighter who had lighted one\nof the street-lamps, and the ray which he had thus sent into the\nsick-chamber passed over the bed.  It did not disturb Boone, for the\ncurtains were between him and it, but it disturbed Gorman, for it fell\non the chimney-piece and illuminated a group of phials, one of which,\nhalf full of a black liquid, was labelled \"_Poison_!\"\n\nGorman started up, and this time did not sit down, but with a trembling\nstep moved to the fireplace.  He stretched out his hand to grasp the\nbottle, and almost overturned it, for just at the moment his own figure\nintercepted the ray of light, and threw the spot where it stood into\ndeep shadow.\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Boone.\n\n\"It's only me,\" said Gorman, \"getting you your physic.  I almost upset\nit in the dark.  Here now, drink it off.  I can't find the cup, but you\ncan take it out of the bottle.\"\n\n\"You won't let _him_ come near when you give it, will you?\" asked Boone\nanxiously.\n\n\"No, no; come, open your mouth.\"\n\nBoone hesitated to do so, but Gorman used a little force.  His hands\nwere steady now!  His heart was steeled to the deed, and the cry which\nBoone was about to utter was choked by the liquid flowing down his\nthroat.\n\nGorman had flung him back with such violence that he lay stunned, while\nthe murderer replaced the bottle on the chimney-piece and hurried to the\ndoor.  A gentle knock at it arrested him, but his indecision was\nmomentary.  He opened the door softly, and going out, said to Mrs Craw\nin a whisper--\n\n\"He's sleeping now.  I found it hard to get him to give up talking, for\nhe waked up soon after I went in; but he's all right now.  I suppose the\nmedicine is beginning to operate; he told me he took it himself just\nbefore I came in.\"\n\n\"Took it himself!\" exclaimed Mrs Craw.  \"Impossible.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know, but he's better now.  I would let him rest a while\nif I were you.\"\n\n\"Stay, sir!  I'll go fetch a light,\" said Mrs Craw.\n\n\"Never mind; I know the stair well,\" said Gorman hurriedly; \"don't mind\na light; I shan't want it.\"\n\nHe was right.  If any man ever wanted darkness rather than light--thick,\nheavy, impenetrable darkness--it was D. Gorman at that time.\n\n\"Took it himself!\" repeated Mrs Craw in unabated surprise as she closed\nthe street door.  \"It's impossible.  He's got no more strength than an\nunborn hinfant.  I must go an' see to this.\"\n\nLighting a candle, she went softly into the sick chamber and looked at\nthe invalid, who was apparently asleep, but breathing heavily.  She then\nwent to the chimney-piece and began to examine the phials there.\n\n\"My!\" she exclaimed suddenly, with a look of alarm, \"if he han't bin an'\ndrunk up all the tinctur' o' rhubarb!  An' the laudanum-bottle standin'\nclose beside it too!  _What_ a mercy he didn't drink that!  Well, lucky\nfor him there wasn't much in it, for an overdose of anything in his\nstate would be serious.\"\n\nFull of her discovery, Mrs Craw set the candle on the table, and sat\ndown on the chair by the bedside to think about it; but the more she\nthought about it the more puzzled she was.\n\n\"Took it himself,\" she said, reverting to Gorman's words.  \"Impossible!\"\n\nShe continued to shake her head and mutter \"Impossible\" for some time,\nwhile she stared at the candle as if she expected that _it_ would solve\nthe mystery.  Then she got up and examined the bedclothes, and found\nthat a good deal of the rhubarb had been spilt on the sheets, and that a\ngood deal more of it had been spilt on Boone's chin and chest; after\nwhich her aspect changed considerably, as, setting down the candle, she\nresumed her seat and said--\n\n\"Took it himself!  Impossible!\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDarkness!  If ever a man sought darkness in vain, and found light,\nbright blazing light, everywhere, it was Gorman.  At first, in a burst\nof frenzy, he rushed away at full speed.  It was well for him that the\nwind had increased to a hurricane and the rain was blinding, else had he\nbeen stopped on suspicion, so fierce was his mien, so haggard his look,\nso wild his race.  Gradually his pace slackened, and gradually as well\nas naturally he gravitated to his old familiar haunts; but go where he\nwould, there was light everywhere except within his own breast.  It was\nall darkness there.\n\nIt is true the sky was dark enough, for the war of elements was so great\nthat it seemed to have been blotted out with ink, but the shops appeared\nto have been lit up more brilliantly than usual.  Every lamp poured a\nflood of light around it.  The lanterns of the cabs and omnibuses sent\nrich beams of light through the air, and the air itself, laden as it was\nwith moisture, absorbed a portion of light, and invested everything with\na halo.  Light, light! all round, and the light of conscience within\nrendering the darkness there visible, and shining on the letters of a\nword written in dark red--\"Murderer!\"\n\nGorman tried to extinguish the light, but it was a fire that would not\nbe put out.  He cursed the shop-windows and the lamps for shining so\nbrightly on him; he cursed the few people whose curiosity induced them\nto pause and look back at him, and he cursed himself for being such a\nfool.\n\nOn reaching Cheapside he began to recover his self-possession, and to\nwalk in the storm as other men did.  But in proportion as his composure\nreturned the enormity of his crime became more apparent to him, and the\nword written in red letters became so bright that he felt as if every\npasser-by must read it, unless he dropt his eyes to prevent their seeing\nthrough them into his soul.\n\nAt London Bridge he became nervously apprehensive.  Each unusually quick\nfootstep startled him.  Every policeman was carefully avoided, and\nanything approaching to a shout behind caused him to start into an\ninvoluntary run.  Despite his utmost efforts to control himself, the\nstrong man was unmanned; a child could have made him fly.\n\nHe was about to cross London Bridge, when he observed a policeman taking\nshelter under the parapet, and apparently watching those who passed him.\nGorman could not make up his mind to go on, so he turned aside and\ndescended the nearest stairs.\n\nThe policeman had doubtless been watching for someone, or suspected\nGorman because of his undecided movements, for he followed him.  The\nlatter observed this and quickened his pace.  The instant he was hidden\nfrom his pursuer, he darted away at full speed, and did not halt until\nhe stood at the foot of one of the stairs where wherries are usually to\nbe found.  The sight that met his gaze there might have overawed the\nmost reckless of men.\n\nA hurricane was raging such as is not often experienced in our favoured\nisland.  The wind blew, not in gusts and squalls, but in one continuous\nroar, lashing the Thames into crested waves, tearing ships from their\nmoorings, and dashing them against other ships, which were likewise\ncarried away, and swept downward with the tide.  Dozens of barges were\nsunk, and the shrieks of their crews were heard sometimes rising above\nthe storm.\n\nThe gale was at its height when Gorman came into full view of the\nThames.  A waterman, who was crouching for shelter in the angle of a\nwarehouse, observed him, and came forward.\n\n\"An awful night, sir,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Gorman curtly.  He started as he spoke, for he heard, or\nhe fancied he heard, a shout behind him.\n\n\"Is that your boat?\" said he.\n\n\"It is,\" replied the waterman in surprise, \"you don't want to go on the\nwater on such a night, do you?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" said Gorman, trembling in every limb; \"come, jump in, and\nshove off.\"\n\nAt that moment a policeman came running down towards them.\n\n\"Are you mad?\" exclaimed the man, grasping Gorman by the arm as he\nsprang toward the boat.\n\nIn a moment, Gorman struck him to the ground, and leaping into the boat\npushed off, just as the policeman came up.  He was whirled away\ninstantly.\n\nGrasping one of the oars, he was just in time to prevent the boat being\ndashed against one of the wooden piers of a wharf.  He was desperate\nnow.  Shipping both oars he pulled madly out into the stream, but in a\nfew moments he was swept against the port-bow of a large vessel, against\nthe stem of which the water was curling as if the ship had been\nbreasting the Atlantic waves before a stiff breeze.  One effort Gorman\nmade to avoid the collision, then he leaped up, and just as the boat\nstruck, sprang at the fore-chains.  He caught them and held on, but his\nhold was not firm; the next moment he was rolling along the vessel's\nside, tearing it with his nails in the vain attempt to grasp the smooth\nhull.  He struck against the bow of the vessel immediately behind and\nwas swept under it.\n\nRising to the surface, he uttered a wild shriek, and attempted to stem\nthe current.  He was a powerful swimmer, and despair lent him energy to\nbuffet the waves for a short time; but he was again swept away by the\nirresistible tide, and had almost given up hope of being saved, when his\nforehead was grazed by a rope which hung from a vessel's side.  Seizing\nthis, he held on, and with much difficulty succeeded in gaining the\nvessel's deck.\n\nWith his safety Gorman's fear of being captured returned.  He hid\nhimself behind some lumber, and while in this position wrung some of the\nwater out of his clothes.  In a few minutes he summoned courage to look\nabout him, and discovered that the vessel was connected with the one\nthat lay next to it by a plank.  No one appeared to be moving, and it\nwas so dark that he could not see more than four or five yards before\nhim.  To pass from one vessel to the other was the work of a few\nseconds.  Finding that the second vessel lay moored to the quay, he\nsprang from it with all his might and alighted safely on the shore.\nFrom the position of the shipping he knew that he stood on the south\nbank of the river, having been swept right across the Thames, so he had\nnow no further difficulty in hiding his guilty head in his own home.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY ONE.\n\nNEW LIGHTS OF VARIOUS KINDS.\n\nTime sped on apace, and in its train came many changes.\n\nTo the confusion of the doctor and despite the would-be murderer, David\nBoone recovered.  But that brought no relief to Gorman, whose remorse\nincreased daily, insomuch that he became, if not quite, very nearly,\ninsane, and his fear of being caught was so great that he never ventured\nnear the quarter of London in which Boone dwelt.  He therefore remained\nin ignorance of the failure of his murderous attempt.  What would he not\nhave given to have known the truth! to have had the dreadful _word_\nremoved from the light which shone upon it brighter and brighter every\nday until it was made red-hot, as it were, and became within him as a\nconsuming fire!  Preferring darkness to light more than ever, Gorman\nkept in secret places during the day, and only ventured out, with other\nhuman vultures, at night.  The wretched man feared the darkness, too,\nalthough he sought it, and what between the darkness that he feared yet\ncourted, and the light that he feared and fled from, and the light\nwithin that he feared but could not fly from, he became one of the most\nmiserable of all the outcasts in London.\n\nAs for his deep-laid plans they were all scattered to the winds.  In the\npresumption of ignorance he had fancied that he knew his own power, and\nso in one sense he did, but he was not aware of his own want of power.\nHe knew, indeed, that he had the brute courage to dare and do anything\ndesperate or dastardly, but he did not know that he lacked the moral\ncourage to bear the consequences of his deeds.  The insurance policies,\ntherefore, lay unclaimed--even uncared for!\n\nAnother change for the worse effected by time was the death of Loo\nAuberly.  Gradually and gently her end approached.  Death was so slow in\ncoming that it was long expected, yet it was so _very_ slow that when it\ncame at last it took her friends by surprise.  James Auberly continued\nstiff and stately to the last.  He refused to believe that his child was\ndying, and spared no expense to provide everything that money could\nprocure to restore her health.  He also refused to be reconciled to his\nson Fred, who had succeeded in his loved profession beyond his\nexpectations, and who had sought, again and again, to propitiate his\nfather.  At last Fred resolved to go abroad and study the works of the\nancient masters.  He corresponded regularly with Loo for some time, but\nhis letters suddenly ceased to make their appearance, and nothing was\nheard of him for many months.\n\nDuring the long and weary illness Loo had three friends whose visits\nwere to her soul like gleams of sunshine on a cloudy day--Miss Tippet,\nEmma Ward, and a poor artificial-flower maker named Ziza Cattley.\n\nThose three, so different yet so like, were almost equally agreeable to\nthe poor invalid.  Miss Tippet was \"_so_ funny but so good,\" and Emma's\nsprightly nature seemed to charm away her pain for a time; while grave,\ngentle, earnest Ziza made her happy during her visits, and left a\nsensation of happiness after she went away.  All three were equally\nuntiring in talking with her about the \"old, old story\"--the Love of\nJesus Christ.\n\nYes, it comes to this at last, if not at first, with all of us.  Even\nthe professed infidel, laugh as he may in the spring-tide of life,\nusually listens to that \"old, old story\" when life's tide is very low,\nif not with faith at least with seriousness, and with a hope that it may\nbe true.  _May_ be true!  Why, if the infidel would only give one tithe\nof the time and trouble and serious inquiry to the investigation of that\nsame old story and its credentials that he gives so freely to the study\nof the subtleties of his art or profession, he would find that there is\nno historical fact whatever within his ken which can boast of anything\nlike the amount or strength of evidence in favour of its truth, that\nexists in favour of the truth of the story of the Life, Death, and\nResurrection of Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\nWhen Loo died the stateliness and stiffness of James Auberly gave way,\nand the stern man, leaning his head upon the coffin, as he sat alone in\nthe darkened room, wept as if he had been a little child.\n\nThere was yet another change brought about by that great overturner\nTime.  But as the change to which we refer affects those who have yet to\ntake a prominent part in our tale, we will suffer them to speak for\nthemselves.\n\nOne afternoon, long after the occurrence of those changes to which\nreference has just been made, Mrs Willders, while seated quietly at her\nown fireside (although there was no fire there, the month being June),\nwas interrupted in her not unusual, though innocent, occupation of\ndarning socks by the abrupt entrance of her son Frank, who flung his cap\non the table, kissed his mother on the forehead, and then flung himself\non the sofa, which piece of furniture, being old and decrepit, groaned\nunder his weight.\n\n\"Mother,\" he exclaimed with animation, \"I've got strange news to tell\nyou.  Is Willie at home?\"\n\n\"No, but I expect him every minute.  He promised to come home earlier\nto-day, and won't be long, for he is a boy of his word.\"\n\nMrs Willders persisted in calling her strapping sons \"boys,\" despite\nthe evidence to the contrary on their cheeks and chins.\n\n\"Here he comes!\" cried Frank, as a rapid step was heard.\n\nNext moment the door burst open and Willie, performing much the same\nceremony that Frank had done, and in a wonderfully similar way, said he\nhad come home with something strange to tell, though not altogether\nstrange either, as his mother, he said, knew something about it already.\n\nMrs Willders smiled and glanced at Frank.\n\n\"Which is to begin first?\" she asked.\n\n\"What! do you know about it, too?\" cried Willie, turning to his brother.\n\n\"_Know_ about what?\" said Frank.  \"You have not told me what it is; how\ncan I answer you?\"\n\n\"About Mr Auberly,\" said Willie.\n\nFrank said that he knew nothing new or peculiar about _him_, except that\nhe was--no, he wouldn't say anything bad of him, for he must be a\nmiserable man at that time.\n\n\"But out with your news, Willie,\" he added, \"mine will keep; and as\nyours is, according to yourself, partly known already to my mother, it's\nas well to finish off one subject before we begin to another.\"\n\n\"Oh, then, you have news, too, have you?\" said Willie.\n\nFrank nodded.\n\n\"Strange coincidence!\" exclaimed Willie.\n\n\"Did you ever hear of a coincidence that was not strange, lad?  Go on\nwith your news, else I'll begin before you.\"\n\nThus admonished, Willie began.\n\n\"Oh, mother, you're a nice deceiver; you're a sly old lady, ain't you?\nand you sit there with a face as meek and sweet and smiling as if you\nhad never deceived anybody in all your life, not to speak of your two\nsons.  O, fy!\"\n\nAs Mrs Willders still smiled and went on with her knitting serenely,\nwithout vouchsafing a reply, Willie continued with an off-hand\nair--\"Well, then, I may as well tell you that I have just had an\ninterview with _Uncle_ Auberly--hallo! you seem surprised.\"\n\nMrs Willders was indeed surprised.  Her serenity of aspect fled in an\ninstant.\n\n\"Oh, Willie, how comes it that you know?  I'm sure I did not mean to\ntell you.  I promised I never would.  I must have let it out\ninadvertently, or when I was asleep.\"\n\n\"Make yourself quite easy, mother,\" said Willie; \"I'll explain it all\npresently.  Just go on with your knitting, and don't put yourself into a\nstate.\"\n\nThe widow, recovering herself a little, resumed her work, and Frank, who\nhad listened with an amused smile up to this point--supposing that his\nbrother was jesting--elongated his face and opened his eyes wider and\nwider as he listened.\n\n\"You must know,\" resumed Willie, \"that I received a note from Mr\nAuberly last night, asking me to call on him some time this afternoon.\nSo I went, and found him seated in his library.  Poor man, he has a\ndifferent look now from what he had when I went last to see him.  You\nknow I have hardly ever seen him since that day when I bamboozled him so\nabout \\`another boy' that he expected to call.  But his spirit is not\nmuch improved, I fear.  \\`Sit down, Mr Willders,' he said.  \\`I asked you\nto call in reference to a matter which I think it well that the parties\nconcerned should understand thoroughly.  Your brother Frank, I am told,\nhas had the presumption to pay his addresses to Miss Ward, the young\nlady who lives with my relative, Miss Tippet.'  \\`Yes, Mr Auberly,' I\nreplied, \\`and Miss Ward has had the presumption to accept him--'\"\n\n\"It was wrong of you to answer so,\" interrupted Mrs Willders, shaking\nher head.\n\n\"Wrong, mother! how could I help it?  Was I going to sit there and hear\nhim talk of Frank's presumption as if he were a chimney-sweep?\"\n\n\"Mr Auberly thinks Miss Ward above him in station, and so deems his\naspiring to her hand presumption,\" replied the widow gently.  \"Besides,\nyou should have remembered the respect due to age.\"\n\n\"Well, but, mother,\" said Willie, defending himself, \"it was very\nimpudent of him, and I did speak very respectfully to him in tone if not\nin words.  The fact is I felt nettled, for, after all, what is Miss\nWard?  The society she mingles in is Miss Tippet's society, and that's\nnot much to boast of; and her father, I believe, was a confectioner--no\ndoubt a rich one, that kept his carriage before he failed, and left his\ndaughter almost a beggar.  But riches don't make a gentleman or a lady\neither, mother; I'm sure you've often told me that, and explained that\neducation, and good training, and good feelings, and polite manners, and\nconsideration for others, were the true foundations of gentility.  If\nthat be so, mother, there are many gentlemen born who are not gentlemen\nbred, and many lowly born who--\"\n\n\"Come, lad, don't bamboozle your mother with sophistries,\" interrupted\nFrank, \"but go on to the point, and don't be so long about it.\"\n\n\"Well, mother,\" resumed Willie, \"Mr Auberly gave me a harder rebuke\nthan you have done, for he made no reply to my speech at all, but went\non as quietly and coolly as if I had not opened my lips.  \\`Now,' said\nhe, \\`I happen to have a particular regard for Miss Ward.  I intend to\nmake her my heir, and I cannot consent to her union with a man who has\n_nothing_.'  \\`Mr Auberly,' said I (and I assure you, mother, I said\nthis quite respectfully), \\`my brother is a man who has little _money_,\nno doubt, but he has a good heart and a good head and a strong arm; an\narm, too, which has saved life before now.'  I stopped at that, for I\nsaw it went home.  \\`Quite true,' he replied; \\`I do not forget that he\nsaved my lost child's life; but--but--the thing is outrageous--that a\npenniless man should wed the lady who is to be my heir!  No, sir, I sent\nfor you to ask you to say to your brother from me, that however much I\nmay respect him I will not consent to this union, and if it goes on\ndespite my wishes I shall not leave Miss Ward a shilling.'  He had\nworked himself up into a rage by this time, and as I felt I would only\nmake matters worse if I spoke, I held my tongue; except that I said I\nwould deliver his message at once, as I expected to meet my brother at\nhome.  He seemed sorry for having been so sharp, however, and when I was\nabout to leave him he tried to smile, and said, \\`I regret to have to\nspeak thus to you, sir, but I felt it to be my duty.  You talk of\nmeeting your brother to-night at home; do you not live together?'  \\`No,\nsir,' I replied; \\`my brother lodges close to his station, and I live\nwith my mother in Notting Hill.'\n\n\"\\`Notting Hill!' he cried, falling back in his chair as if he had been\nstruck by a thunderbolt.  \\`Your mother,' he gasped, \\`Mrs Willders--my\nsister-in-law--the waterman's widow?'  \\`A _sailor's_ widow, sir,' said\nI, \\`who is proud of the husband, who rose to the top of his profession.'\n\n\"\\`Why did you deceive me, sir?' cried Mr Auberly, with a sudden frown.\n\\`I would have undeceived you,' said I, \\`when we first met, but you\ndismissed me abruptly at that time, and would not hear me out.  Since\nthen, I have not thought it worth while to intrude on you in reference\nto so small a matter--for I did not know till this day that we are\nrelated.'  He frowned harder than ever at this, and bit his lip, and\nthen said, \\`Well, young man, _this_ will make no difference, I assure\nyou.  I desire you to convey my message to your brother.  Leave me now.'\nI was just on the point of saying \\`Good-bye, uncle,' but he covered his\nface with his hands, and looked so miserable, that I went out without a\nword more.  There, you've got the whole of _my_ story.  What think you\nof it?\"\n\n\"It's a curious one, and very unexpected, at least by me,\" said Frank,\n\"though, as you said, part of it must have been known to mother, who, no\ndoubt, had good reasons for concealing it from us; but I rather think\nthat my story will surprise you more, and it's a better one than yours,\nWillie, in this respect, that it is shorter.\"\n\n\"Come, then, out with it,\" said Willie, with a laugh; \"why, this is\nsomething like one of the Arabian Nights' Entertainments.\"\n\n\"Well, mother,\" said Frank, laying his hand gently on the widow's\nshoulder, \"you shan't darn any more socks if I can help it, for I'm a\nman of fortune now!\"\n\n\"How, Frank?\" said Mrs Willders, with a puzzled look.\n\n\"The fact is, mother, that Mrs Denman, the poor old lady whom I carried\ndown the escape, I forget how many years ago, is dead, and has left me\nher fortune, which, I believe, amounts to something like twenty thousand\npounds!\"\n\n\"You _don't_ mean that!\" cried Willie, starting up.\n\n\"Indeed, I do,\" said Frank earnestly.\n\n\"Then long life to ye, my boy!\" cried Willie, wringing his brother's\nhand, \"and success to the old--well, no, I don't exactly mean that, but\nif she were alive I would say my blessing on the old lady.  I wish you\njoy, old fellow!  I say, surely the stately man won't object to the\npenniless fireman now--ha! ha!  Well, it's like a dream; but tell us all\nabout it, Frank.\"\n\n\"There is very little to tell, lad.  I got a very urgent message the day\nbefore yesterday to go to see an old lady who was very ill.  I obtained\nleave for an hour, and went at once, not knowing who it was till I got\nthere, when I found that it was Mrs Denman.  She looked very ill, and I\ndo assure you I felt quite unmanned when I looked into her little old\nface.  \\`Young man,' she said in a low voice, \\`you saved my life; I am\ndying, and have sent for you to thank you.  God bless you.'  She put out\nher thin hand and tried to shake mine, but it was too feeble; she could\nonly press her fingers on it.  That was all that passed, and I returned\nto the station feeling quite in low spirits, I do assure you.  Well,\nnext day a little man in black called, and said he wished to have a few\nwords with me.  So I went out, and he introduced himself as the old\nlady's lawyer, told me that she was gone, and that she had, almost with\nher last breath, made him promise to go, the moment she was dead, and\nsee the fireman who had saved her life, and tell him that she had left\nher fortune to him.  He congratulated me; said that there were no near\nrelations to feel aggrieved or to dispute my rights, and that, as soon\nas the proper legal steps had been taken--the debts and legacies paid,\netcetera,--he would have the pleasure of handing over the balance, which\nwould probably amount to twenty thousand pounds.\"\n\n\"It's like a dream,\" said Willie.\n\n\"So it is,\" replied Frank, \"but it's well that it is not a dream, for if\nI had been the penniless man that Mr Auberly thinks me, I would have\nbeen obliged in honour to give up Emma Ward.\"\n\n\"Give her up!\" exclaimed Willie in amazement.  \"Why?\"\n\n\"Why! because I could not think of standing in the way of her good\nfortune.\"\n\n\"Oh, Frank! oh, Blazes,\" said Willie sadly, \"has money told on you so\nfearfully already?  Do you think that _she_ would give _you_ up for the\nsake of Auberly's dross?\"\n\n\"I believe not, lad; but--but--well--never mind, we won't be troubled\nwith the question now.  But, mother, you don't seem to think much of my\ngood fortune.\"\n\n\"I do think much of it, Frank; it has been sent to you by the Lord, and\ntherefore is to be received with thanksgiving.  But sudden good fortune\nof this kind is very dangerous.  It makes me anxious as well as glad.\"\n\nAt that moment there came a loud knocking at the door, which startled\nMrs Willders, and caused Willie to leap up and rush to open it.\n\nFrank rose and put on his cap with the quiet promptitude of a man\naccustomed to alarms.\n\n\"That's a fire, mother; the kind of knock is quite familiar to me now.\nDon't be alarmed; we hear that kind of thing about two or three times a\nday at the station; they knew I was here, and have sent a messenger.\"\n\n\"A fire!\" cried Willie, running into the room in great excitement.\n\n\"Tut, lad,\" said Frank, with a smile, as he nodded to his mother and\nleft the room, \"you'd never do for a fireman, you're too excitable.\nWhere's the messenger?--ah, here you are.  Well, where is it?\"\n\n\"Tooley Street,\" exclaimed a man, whose condition showed that he had run\nall the way.\n\nFrank started, and looked very grave as he said hurriedly to his\nbrother--\n\n\"Good-night, lad.  I won't likely be able to get out to-morrow to talk\nover this matter of the fortune.  Fires are usually bad in that\nneighbourhood.  Look well after mother.  Good-night.\"\n\nIn another moment he was gone.\n\nAnd well might Frank look grave, for when a fireman is called to a fire\nin Tooley Street, or any part of the docks, he knows that he is about to\nenter into the thickest of the Great Fight.  To ordinary fires he goes\nlight-heartedly--as a bold trooper gallops to a skirmish, but to a fire\nin the neighbourhood of the docks he goes with something of the feeling\nwhich must fill the breast of every brave soldier on the eve of a great\nbattle.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY TWO.\n\nTHE FIRE IN TOOLEY STREET.\n\nOne of those great calamities which visit us once or twice, it may be,\nin a century, descended upon London on Saturday, the 22nd of June, 1861.\nIt was the sudden, and for the time, overwhelming, attack of an old and\nunconquerable enemy, who found us, as usual, inadequately prepared to\nmeet him.\n\nFire has fought with us and fed upon us since we became a nation, and\nyet, despite all our efforts, its flames are at this day more furious\nthan ever.  There are more fires daily in London now than there ever\nwere before.  Has this foe been properly met? is a question which\nnaturally arises out of this fact.  Referring to the beautiful\norganisation of the present Fire Brigade, the ability of its chiefs and\nthe courage of its men, the answer is, Yes, decidedly.  But referring to\nthe strength of the brigade; to the munitions of war in the form of\nwater; to the means of conveyance in the form of mains; to the system of\ncheck in the shape of an _effective_ Act in reference to partition-walls\nand moderately-sized warehouses; to the means of prevention in the shape\nof prohibitions and regulations in regard to inflammable substances--\nreferring to all these things, the answer to the question, \"Has the foe\nbeen properly met?\" is emphatically, _No_.\n\nIt is not sufficient to reply that a special inquiry has been made into\nthis subject; that steps are being actually taken to remedy the evils of\nour system (or rather of our want of system) of fire prevention.  Good\nmay or may not result from this inquiry: that is yet to be seen.\nMeanwhile, the public ought to be awakened more thoroughly to the fact\nthat an enemy is and always has been abroad in our land, who might be,\n_if we chose_, more effectively checked; who, if he has not yet attacked\nour own particular dwelling, may take us by surprise any day when we\nleast expect him, and who does at all times very materially diminish our\nnational wealth and increase our public burdens.  Perhaps we should not\nstyle _fire_ an enemy, but a mutinous servant, who does his work\nfaithfully and well, except when neglected or abused!\n\nAbout five o'clock on Saturday afternoon intelligence of the outbreak of\nfire in Tooley Street reached the headquarters of the brigade in Watling\nStreet.\n\nFire in Tooley Street!  The mere summons lent energy to the nerves and\nspring to the muscles of the firemen.  Not that Tooley Street in itself\nis more peculiarly dangerous in regard to fire than are the other\nstreets of shops in the City.  But Tooley Street lies in dangerous\nneighbourhood.  The streets between it and the Thames, and those lying\nimmediately to the west of it, contain huge warehouses and bonded\nstores, which are filled to suffocation with the \"wealth of nations.\"\nDirty streets and narrow lanes here lead to the fountain-head of wealth\nuntold--almost inconceivable.  The elegant filigree-work of West End\nluxury may here be seen unsmelted, as it were, and in the ore.  At the\nsame time the rich substances on which fire feeds and fattens are stored\nhere in warehouses which (as they are) should never have been built, and\nin proximities which should never have been permitted.  Examine the\nwharves--Brooks' Wharf, Beal's Wharf, Cotton's Wharf, Chamberlain's\nWharf, Freeman's Wharf, Griffin's Wharf, Stanton's Wharf, and others.\nInvestigate the lanes--Hay's Lane, Mill Lane, Morgan's Lane; and the\nstreets--Bermondsey, Dockhead, Pickle Herring Street, Horsleydown, and\nothers--and there, besides the great deposit and commission warehouses\nwhich cover acres of ground, and are filled from basement to ridge-pole\nwith the commodities and combustibles of every clime, you will find huge\ngranaries and stores of lead, alum, drugs, tallow, chicory, flour, rice,\nbiscuit, sulphur, and saltpetre, mingled with the warehouses of\ncheese-agents, ham-factors, provision merchants, tarpaulin-dealers, oil\nand colour merchants, etcetera.  In fact, the entire region seems laid\nout with a view to the raising of a bonfire or a pyrotechnic display on\nthe grandest conceivable scale.\n\nLittle wonder, then, that the firemen of Watling Street turned out all\ntheir engines, including two of Shand and Mason's new land-steam\nfire-engines, which had at that time just been brought into action.\nLittle wonder that the usual request for a man from each station was\nchanged into an urgent demand for every man that could possibly be\nspared.\n\nThe fire began in the extensive wharves and warehouses known as Cotton's\nWharf, near London Bridge, and was first observed in a warehouse over a\ncounting-room by some workmen, who at once gave the alarm, and attempted\nto extinguish it with some buckets of water.  They were quickly driven\nback, however, by the suffocating smoke, which soon filled the various\nfloors so densely that no one could approach the seat of the fire.\n\nMr Braidwood, who was early on the spot, saw at a glance that a pitched\nbattle was about to be fought, and, like a wise general, concentrated\nall the force at his command.  Expresses were sent for the more distant\nbrigade engines, and these came dashing up, one after another, at full\nspeed.  The two powerful steam floating-engines which guard the Thames\nfrom fire were moored off the wharf, two lengths of hose attached to\nthem, and led on shore and brought to bear on the fire.  A number of\nland-engines took up a position in Tooley Street, ready for action, but\nthese were compelled to remain idle for nearly an hour _before water was\nobtainable from the fire-plugs_.  O London! with all your wealth and\nwisdom, how strange that such words can be truly written of you!\n\nThe vessels which were lying at the wharf discharging and loading were\nhauled out of danger into the stream.\n\nIn course of time the engines were in full play, but the warehouse burst\ninto flames from basement to roof in spite of them, and ere long eight\nof the great storehouses were burning furiously.  The flames made rapid\nwork of it, progressing towards the line of warehouses facing the river,\nand to the lofty building which adjoined on the Tooley Street side.\n\nDale and his men were quickly on the scene of action, and had their\nengine soon at work.  Before long, Frank Willders joined them.  They\nwere playing in at the windows of a large store, which was burning so\nfuriously that the interior appeared to be red-hot.\n\n\"Relieve Corney, lad,\" said Dale, as Frank came forward.\n\n\"Och, it's time!\" cried Corney, delivering up the branch to Frank and\nMoxey; \"sure Baxmore and me are melted intirely.\"\n\nFrank made no reply.  He and Moxey directed the branch which the others\nresigned, turning their backs as much as possible on the glowing fire,\nand glancing at it over their shoulders; for it was too hot to be faced.\n\nJust then the Chief of the brigade came up.\n\n\"It's of no use, sir,\" said Dale; \"we can't save these.\"\n\n\"True, Dale, true,\" said Mr Braidwood, in a quick, but quiet tone;\n\"this block is doomed.  Take your lads round to the nor'-east corner; we\nmust try to prevent it spreading.\"\n\nAs he surveyed the progress of the fire, with a cool, practical eye, and\nhurried off to another part of the battle-field to post his men to best\nadvantage, little did the leader of the forces think that he was to be\nthe first to fall that day!\n\nEngines were now playing on the buildings in all directions; but the\nflames were so fierce that they made no visible impression on them, and\neven in the efforts made to check their spreading, little success\nappeared to attend them at first.  Warehouse after warehouse ignited.\n\nTo make matters worse, a fresh breeze sprang up, and fanned the flames\ninto redoubled fury; so that they quickly caught hold of vast portions\nof the premises occupied by the firm of Scovell and Company.\n\n\"There's not a chance,\" said Frank to Dale, while he wiped the\nperspiration from his forehead, and sat down for a few seconds to\nrecover breath; for he had just issued from a burning building, driven\nback by heat and smoke--\n\n\"There's not a chance of saving that block; all the iron doors that were\nmeant to keep the fire from spreading have been left open by the\nworkmen!\"\n\n\"Chance or no chance, we must do our best,\" said Dale.  \"Come, lad, with\nme; I think we may get at a door inside the next warehouse, through\nwhich we might bring the branch to bear.  Are you able?\"\n\n\"All right,\" exclaimed Frank, leaping up, and following his leader\nthrough the smoke.\n\n\"Have a care!\" cried Frank, pausing as a tremendous explosion caused the\nground to tremble under their feet.\n\n\"It's sulphur or saltpetre,\" said Dale, pushing on; \"there are tons upon\ntons of that stuff in the cellars all round.\"\n\nThis was indeed the case.  It was said that upwards of 2,000 tons of\nsaltpetre were in the vaults at the time; and several explosions had\nalready taken place, though fortunately, without doing injury to any\none.\n\nDale had already partially examined the warehouse, into which he now led\nFrank; and, therefore, although it was full of smoke, he moved rapidly\nalong the narrow and intricate passages between the bales of goods,\nuntil he reached an iron door.\n\n\"Here it is; we'll open this and have a look,\" he said, grasping the\nhandle and swinging the heavy door open.\n\nInstantly, a volume of black smoke drove both the men back, almost\nsuffocating them.  They could not speak; but each knew that the\nre-closing of that iron door was all-important, for the fire had got\nnearer to it than Dale had imagined.\n\nThey both darted forward; but were again driven back, and had to rush to\nthe open air for breath.  Frank recovered before his comrade, in\nconsequence of the latter having made a more strenuous and prolonged\neffort to close the door which he had so unfortunately opened.\n\nWithout a moment's hesitation, he sprang into the warehouse again;\nregained and partially closed the door, when the stifling smoke choked\nhim, and he fell to the ground.  A few seconds later, Dale followed him,\nand found him there.  Applying his great strength with almost superhuman\nenergy to the door, it shut with a crash, and the communication between\nthe buildings was cut off!  Dale then seized Frank by the collar, and\ndragged him into the open air, when he himself almost sank to the\nground.  Fresh air, however, soon restored them both, and in a few\nminutes they were actively engaged at another part of the building.\n\nBravely and perseveringly though this was done, it availed not, for\nnothing could withstand the fury of the fire.  The warehouse caught, and\nwas soon a glowing mass like the others, while the flames raged with\nsuch violence that their roaring drowned the shouting of men, and the\nmore distant roar of the innumerable multitude that densely covered\nLondon Bridge, and clustered on every eminence from which a safe view of\nthe great fire could be obtained.\n\nThe floating fire-engines had now been at work for some time, and the\nmen in charge of their branches were suffering greatly from the intense\nheat.  About this time, nearly seven o'clock in the evening, Mr\nBraidwood went to these men to give them a word of encouragement.  He\nproceeded down one of the approaches to the river from Tooley Street,\nand stopped when nearly half way to give some directions, when a sudden\nand tremendous explosion, took place, shaking the already tottering\nwalls, which at this place were of great height.  A cry was raised,\n\"Run! the wall is falling!\"  Every one sprang away at the word.  The\nwall bulged out at the same time; and one of the firemen, seeing that\nMr Braidwood was in imminent danger, made a grasp at him as he was\nspringing from the spot; but the heavy masses of brick-work dashed him\naway, and, in another moment, the gallant chief of the Fire Brigade lay\nburied under at least fifteen feet of burning ruin.\n\nAny attempt at rescue would have been impossible as well as unavailing,\nfor death must have been instantaneous.  The hero's warfare with the\nflames, which had lasted for upwards of thirty-eight years, was ended;\nand his brave spirit returned to God Who gave it.\n\nThat a man of no ordinary note had fallen was proved, before many hours\nhad passed, by the deep and earnest feeling of sorrow and sympathy which\nwas manifested by all classes in London, from Queen Victoria downwards,\nas well as by the public funeral which took place a few days afterwards,\nat which were present the Duke of Sutherland, the Earl of Caithness, the\nReverend Doctor Cumming, and many gentlemen connected with the insurance\noffices; the committee and men of the London Fire Brigade; also those of\nvarious private and local brigades; the secretary and conductors of the\nRoyal Society for the Protection of Life from Fire; the mounted\nMetropolitan and City police; the London Rifle Brigade (of which Mr\nBraidwood's three sons were members); the superintendents and men of the\nvarious water companies; and a long string of private and mourning\ncarriages: to witness the progress of which hundreds of thousands of\npeople densely crowded the streets and clustered in the windows and on\nevery available eminence along the route; while in Cheapside almost all\nthe shops were shut and business was suspended; and in the neighbourhood\nof Shoreditch toiling thousands of artisans came forth from factory and\nworkshop to \"see the last of Braidwood,\" whose name had been so long\nfamiliar to them as a \"household word.\"  The whole heart of London\nseemed to have been moved by one feeling, and the thousands who thronged\nthe streets \"had\" (in the language of one of the papers of the day)\n\"gathered together to witness the funeral, not of a dead monarch, not of\na great warrior, not of a distinguished statesman, not even of a man\nfamous in art, in literature, or in science, but simply of James\nBraidwood, late superintendent of the London Fire-Engine\nEstablishment\"--a true hero, and one who was said, by those who knew him\nbest, to be an earnest Christian man.\n\nBut at the moment of his fall his men were engaged in the thick of\nbattle.  Crushing though the news of his death was, there was no\nbreathing time to realise it.\n\nThe fierce heat had not only driven back the firemen on shore, but had\ncompelled the floating fire-engines to haul off, in consequence of the\nflaming matter which poured over the wharf wall and covered the surface\nof the river the entire length of the burning warehouses; while the\nwhole of the carriageway of Tooley Street was ankle deep in hot oil and\ntallow.  After the fall of their Chief, Messrs. Henderson and Fogo, two\nof the principal officers of the brigade, did their utmost to direct the\nenergies of the men.\n\nNight closed in, and the flames continued to rage in all their fury and\nmagnificence.  News of this great fire spread with the utmost rapidity\nover the metropolis.  Indeed, it was visible at Hampstead while it was\nyet daylight.  When darkness set in, one of the most extraordinary\nscenes that London ever produced was witnessed.  From all quarters the\npeople came pouring in, on foot, in omnibus, cab, pleasure-van, cart,\nand waggon--all converging to London Bridge.  At nine o'clock the bridge\nand its approaches presented all the appearance of the Epsom Road on the\nDerby Day.  Cabs and 'buses plied backwards and forwards on the bridge\nall night, carrying an unlimited number of passengers at 2 pence and 3\npence each, and thousands of persons spent the night in thus passing to\nand fro.  The railway terminus, Billingsgate Market, the roof of the\nCoal Exchange, the Monument, the quays, the windows, the house-tops, the\nsteeples, and the chimney-stalks--all were crowded with human beings,\nwhose eager upturned faces were rendered intensely bright against the\nsurrounding darkness by the fierce glare of the fire.  But the Thames\npresented the most singular appearance of all--now reflecting on its\nbosom the inky black clouds of smoke; anon the red flames, as fresh fuel\nwas licked up by the devouring element, and, occasionally, sheets of\nsilver light that flashed through the chaos when sulphur and saltpetre\nexplosions occurred.  Mountains of flame frequently burst away from the\nmass of burning buildings and floated upward for a few moments, and the\ntallow and tar which flowed out of the warehouses floated away blazing\nwith the tide and set the shipping on fire, so that land and water alike\nseemed to be involved in one huge terrific conflagration.\n\nThe utmost consternation prevailed on board the numerous craft on the\nriver in the vicinity of the fire, for thick showers of sparks and\nburning materials fell incessantly.  Gusts of wind acted on the ruins\nnow and then, and at such moments the gaunt walls, cracked and riven out\nof shape, stood up, glowing with intense white heat in the midst of a\nsea of fire from which red flames and dark clouds of smoke were vomited,\nas from the crater of some mighty volcano, with a roar that mingled with\nthe shouts of excited thousands, and drowned even the dull incessant\nthumpings of the engines that worked in all directions.\n\nMoored alongside of Chamberlain's Wharf was a small sloop.  Little blue\nblisters of light broke out on her rigging; soon these increased in\nsize, and in a few minutes she was on fire from stem to stern.\nImmediately after, there came a barge with flowing sails, borne on the\nrising tide.  She passed too near to the conflagration.  Her crew of\nthree men became panic-stricken and lost control of her.  At sight of\nthis a great shout was raised, and a boat put off and rescued the crew;\nbut almost before they were landed their barge was alight from stem to\nstern.  The tremendous cheer that burst from the excited multitude at\nsight of this rescue rose for a moment above the roaring of the\nconflagration.  Then another barge was set on fire by the blazing tallow\nwhich floated out to her, but she was saved by being scuttled.\n\nIn the midst of such a scene it was to be expected that there would be\ndamage to life and limb.  The firemen, besides being exposed to intense\nheat for hours, were almost blinded and choked by the smoke emitted from\nthe burning pepper--more especially the cayenne--of which there was a\nlarge quantity in the warehouses.  Some of the men who were working the\nengines fell into the river and were drowned.  A gentleman who was\nassisting the firemen had his hand impaled on an iron spike.  A poor\nIrishman had his neck broken by the chain of the floating-engine, and\nseveral of the police force and others were carried to hospital badly\nburned and otherwise injured.\n\nSome of the casualties occurred in places where only a few persons were\nthere to witness them, but others were enacted on the river, and on\nspots which were in full view of the vast multitudes on London Bridge.\nA boat containing five men put off to collect the tallow which floated\non the water, but it got surrounded by tallow which had caught fire, and\nthe whole of its occupants were either burned to death or drowned.\nLater in the night a small skiff rowed by a single man was drawn by the\ntide into the vortex of the fire.  Another boat ran out and saved the\nman, but a second boat which was pulled off by a single rower for the\nsame purpose was drawn too near the fire, and its brave occupant\nperished.  So eager were the multitude on the bridge to witness these\nscenes that some of themselves were forced over the parapet into the\nriver and drowned.\n\nComical incidents were strangely mingled with these awful scenes,\nalthough it is but justice to say the prevailing tone of the crowd was\none of solemnity.  Itinerant vendors of ginger-beer, fruit, cakes, and\ncoffee ranged themselves along the pavements and carried on a brisk\ntrade--especially after the public-houses were closed, many of which,\nhowever, taking advantage of the occasion, kept open door all night.\n\nAmong these last was the \"Angel,\" belonging to Gorman.\n\nThat worthy was peculiarly active on this occasion.  He never neglected\nan opportunity of turning an honest penny, and, accordingly, had been\nengaged from an early hour in his boat collecting tallow; of which\nplunder a considerable amount had been already conveyed to his abode.\n\nBesides Gorman, several of the other personages of our tale found their\nway to the great centre of attraction, London Bridge, on that night.\nAmong them was John Barret, who, on hearing of the fire, had left his\nsnug little villa and pretty little wife to witness it.\n\nHe had already made one or two cheap trips on one of the omnibuses, and,\nabout midnight, got down and forced his way to a position near the south\nside of the bridge.  Here he was attracted to a ginger-beer barrow which\nan unusually adventurous man had pushed through the crowd into a\nsheltered corner.  He forced his way to it, and, to his amazement, found\nthe owner to be his former friend Ned Hooper.\n\n\"Hallo!  Barret.\"\n\n\"Why, Ned!\" were the exclamations that burst simultaneously from their\nlips.\n\n\"This is a strange occupation,\" said Barret with a smile.\n\n\"Ah, it may seem strange to you, no doubt, but it's familiar enough to\nme,\" replied Ned, with a grin.\n\nThe demand for beer was so great at this time that Ned could not\ncontinue the conversation.\n\n\"Here, boy,\" he said to an urchin who stood near, \"you draw corks as\nfast as you can and pour out the beer, and I'll give you a copper or two\nand a swig into the bargain.\"\n\nThe boy accepted the post of salesman with alacrity, and Ned turned to\nhis friend and seized his hand.\n\n\"Barret,\" said he, in a low, earnest voice, \"if I succeed in holding\nout, I own my salvation, under God, to you.  I've tasted nothing but\nginger-beer for many a long day, and I really believe that I have got my\nenemy down at last.  It's not a lucrative business, as you may see,\" he\nadded with a sad smile, glancing at his threadbare garments, \"nor a very\naristocratic one.\"\n\n\"My dear Ned,\" cried Barret, interrupting, and suddenly thrusting his\nhand into his pocket.\n\n\"No, Barret, no,\" said Ned firmly, as he laid his hand on the other's,\narm; \"I don't want money; I've given up begging.  You gave me your\nadvice once, and I have taken that--it has been of more value to me than\nall the wealth that is being melted into thin air, John, by yonder\nfire--\"\n\nNed was interrupted at this point by a burst of laughter from the crowd.\nThe cause of their mirth was the appearance of a tall, thin, and very\nlugubrious-looking man who had come on the bridge to see the fire.  He\nhad got so excited that he had almost fallen over the parapet, and a\npoliceman had kindly offered to escort him to a place of safety.\n\n\"Why, what d'ye mean?--what d'ye take me for?\" cried the tall man\nangrily; \"I'm an honest man; my name is David Boone; I've only come to\nsee the fire; you've no occasion to lay hold o' _me_!\"\n\n\"I know that,\" said the policeman; \"I only want to get you out of\ndanger.  Come along now.\"\n\nJust then a thickset man with a red handkerchief tied round his head\ncame forward to the stall and demanded a glass of beer.  The moment his\neyes encountered those of Boone he became pale as death and staggered\nback as if he had received a deadly blow.\n\n\"Is that you, Gorman?\" cried David, in a voice and with an expression of\namazement.\n\nGorman did not reply, but gazed at his former friend with a look of\nintense horror, while his chest heaved and he breathed laboriously.\nSuddenly he uttered a loud cry and rushed towards the river.\n\nPart of the crowd sprang after him, as if with a view to arrest him, or\nto see what he meant to do.  In the rush Barret and Boone were carried\naway.\n\nA few moments later a deep murmur of surprise rose from the thousands of\nspectators on the bridge, for a boat was seen to dash suddenly from the\nshore and sweep out on the river.  It was propelled by a single rower--a\nman with a red kerchief tied round his head.  The murmur of the crowd\nsuddenly increased to a shout of alarm, for the man was rowing, his boat\nstraight towards a mass of tallow which floated and burned on the water.\n\n\"Hold on!\"  \"Lookout ahead!\" shouted several voices, while others\nscreamed \"Too late!\"  \"He's gone!\" and then there arose a wild cry, for\nthe man rowed straight into the centre of the burning mass and was\nenveloped in the flames.  For one moment he was seen to rise and swing\nhis arms in the air--then he fell backwards over the gunwale of his boat\nand disappeared in the blazing flood.\n\nFiercer and fiercer raged the fire.  The night passed--the day came and\nwent, and night again set in--yet still the flames leaped and roared in\nresistless fury, and still the firemen fought them valiantly.  And thus\nthey fought, day and night, hand to hand, for more than a fortnight,\nbefore the battle was thoroughly ended and the victory gained.\n\nHow the firemen continued to do their desperate work, day and night,\nalmost without rest, it is impossible to tell.  Frank Willders said\nthat, after the first night, he went about his work like a man in a\ndream.  He scarcely knew when, or how, or where he rested or ate.  He\nhad an indistinct remembrance of one or two brief intervals of oblivion\nwhen he supposed he must have been asleep, but the only memory that\nremained strong and clear within him was that of constant, determined\nfighting with the flames.  And Willie Willders followed him like his\nshadow! clad in a coat and helmet borrowed from a friend in the Salvage\nCorps.  Willie fought in that great fight as if he had been a trained\nfireman.\n\nOn the fourth day, towards evening, Frank was ordered down into a cellar\nwhere some tar-barrels were burning.  He seized the branch, and was\nabout to leap down the stair when Dale stopped him.\n\n\"Fasten the rope to your belt,\" he said.\n\nFrank obeyed without speaking and then sprang forward, while Dale\nhimself followed, ordering Corney, Baxmore, and one or two others, to\nhold on to the ropes.  Willie Willders also ran in, but was met by such\na dense cloud of smoke that he was almost choked.  Rushing back, he\nshouted, \"Haul on the ropes!\"\n\nThe men were already hauling them in, and in a few seconds Dale and\nFrank were dragged by their waist-belts into the open air, the former\nnearly, and the latter quite, insensible.\n\nIn a few minutes they both recovered, and another attempt was made to\nreach the fire in the cellar, but without success.\n\nThe public did not witness this incident.  The firemen were almost\nsurrounded by burning ruins, and none but comrades were there.\n\nIndeed, the public seldom see the greatest dangers to which the fireman\nis exposed.  It is not when he makes his appearance on some giddy height\non a burning and tottering house, and is cheered enthusiastically by the\ncrowd, that his courage is most severely tried.  It is when he has to\ncreep on hands and knees through dense smoke, and hold the branch in the\nface of withering heat, while beams are cracking over his head, and\nburning rubbish is dropping around, and threatening to overwhelm him--it\nis in such circumstances, when the public know nothing of what is going\non, and when no eye sees him save that of the solitary comrade who\nshares his toil and danger, that the fireman's nerve and endurance are\ntested to the uttermost.\n\nAfter leaving the cellar, Dale and his men went to attempt to check the\nfire in a quarter where it threatened to spread, and render this--the\ngreatest of modern conflagrations--equal to the great one of 1666.\n\n\"We might reach it from that window,\" said Dale to Frank, pointing to a\nhouse, the sides of which were already blistering, and the glass\ncracking with heat.\n\nFrank seized the branch and gained the window in question, but could not\ndo anything very effective from that point.  He thought, however, that\nfrom a window in an adjoining store he might play directly on a house\nwhich was in imminent danger.  But the only means of reaching it was by\npassing over a charred beam, thirty feet beneath which lay a mass of\nsmouldering ruins.  For one moment he hesitated, uncertain whether or\nnot the beam would sustain his weight.  But the point to be gained was\none of great importance, so he stepped boldly forward, carrying the\nbranch with him.  As he advanced, the light of the fire fell brightly\nupon him, revealing his tall figure clearly to the crowd, which cheered\nhim heartily.\n\nAt that moment the beam gave way.  Willie, who was about to follow, had\nbarely time to spring back and gain a firm footing, when he beheld his\nbrother fall headlong into the smoking ruins below.\n\nIn another moment he had leaped down the staircase, and was at Frank's\nside.  Baxmore, Dale, Corney, and others, followed, and, in the midst of\nfire and smoke, they raised their comrade in their arms and bore him to\na place of safety.\n\nNo one spoke, but a stretcher was quickly brought, and Frank was\nconveyed in a state of insensibility to the nearest hospital, where his\nmanly form--shattered, burned, and lacerated--was laid on a bed.  He\nbreathed, although he was unconscious and evinced no sign of feeling\nwhen the surgeons examined his wounds.\n\nA messenger was despatched for Mrs Willders, and Willie remained to\nwatch beside him while his comrades went out to continue the fight.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY THREE.\n\nTHE LAST.\n\nFor many months Frank Willders lay upon his bed unable to move, and\nscarcely able to speak.  His left leg and arm had been broken, his face\nand hands were burned and cut, and his once stalwart form was reduced to\na mere wreck.\n\nDuring that long and weary time of suffering he had two nurses who never\nleft him--who relieved each other day and night; smoothed his pillow and\nread to him words of comfort from God's blessed book.  These were, his\nown mother and Emma Ward.\n\nFor many weeks his life seemed to waver in the balance, but at last he\nbegan to mend.  His frame, however, had been so shattered that the\ndoctors held out little hope of his ever being anything better than a\nhelpless cripple, so, one day, he said to Emma:\n\n\"I have been thinking, Emma, of our engagement.\"  He paused and spoke\nsadly--as if with great difficulty.\n\n\"And I have made up my mind,\" he continued, \"to release you.\"\n\n\"Frank!\" exclaimed Emma.\n\n\"Yes, dear.  No one can possibly understand what it costs me to say\nthis, but it would be the worst kind of selfishness were I to ask you to\nmarry a poor wretched cripple like me.\"\n\n\"But what if I refuse to be released, Frank?\" said Emma, with a smile;\n\"you may, indeed, be a cripple, but you shall not be a wretched one if\nit is in my power to make you happy; and as to your being poor--what of\nthat?  I knew you were not rich when I accepted you, and you know I have\na very, very small fortune of my own which will at least enable us to\nexist until you are able to work again.\"\n\nFrank looked at her in surprise, for he had not used the word _poor_\nwith reference to money.\n\n\"Has mother, then, not told you anything about my circumstances of\nlate?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, nothing; what could she tell me that I do not already know?\" said\nEmma.\n\nFrank made no reply for a few moments, then he said with a sad yet\ngratified smile--\n\n\"So you refuse to be released?\"\n\n\"Yes, Frank, unless you _insist_ on it,\" replied Emma.\n\nAgain the invalid relapsed into silence and shut his eyes.  Gradually he\nfell into a quiet slumber, from which, about two hours later, he awoke\nwith a start under the impression that he had omitted to say something.\nLooking up he found that his mother had taken Emma's place.  He at once\nasked why she had not told Emma about the change in his fortunes.\n\n\"Because I thought it best,\" said Mrs Willders, \"to leave you to tell\nher yourself, Frank.\"\n\n\"Well, mother, I depute you to tell her now, and pray do it without\ndelay.  I offered to give her up a short time ago, but she refused to\nlisten to me.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to hear it,\" replied the widow with a smile.  \"I always\nthought her a good, sensible girl.\"\n\n\"Hm! so did I,\" said Frank, \"and something more.\"\n\nOnce again he became silent, and, as an inevitable consequence, fell\nfast asleep.  In which satisfactory state we will leave him while we run\nbriefly over the events of his subsequent history.\n\nIn direct opposition to the opinion of all his doctors, Frank not only\nrecovered the use of all his limbs, but became as well and strong as\never--and the great fire in Tooley Street left no worse marks upon him\nthan a few honourable scars.\n\nHis recovery, however, was tedious.  The state of his health, coupled\nwith the state of his fortune, rendered it advisable that he should seek\nthe benefit of country air, so he resigned his situation in the London\nFire Brigade--resigned it, we may add, with deep regret, for some of his\nhappiest days had been spent in connection with that gallant corps.\n\nRambling and fishing among the glorious mountains of Wales with his\nbrother Willie, he speedily regained health and strength.  While\nwandering with delight through one of the most picturesque scenes of\nthat wild and beautiful region, he came suddenly one day on a large\nwhite umbrella, under which sat a romantic-looking man, something\nbetween an Italian bandit and an English sportsman, who was deeply\nengrossed with a sheet of paper on which he was depicting one of the\ngrandest views in the splendid pass of Llanberis.  At this man Willie\nrushed with a shout of surprise, and found that he answered at once to\nthe name of Fred Auberly!  Fred was thrown into such a state of delight\nat the sight of his old friends that he capsized the white umbrella,\npacked up his paints, and accompanied them to their inn.  Here, on being\nquestioned, he related how that, while in Rome he had been seized with a\nfever which laid him prostrate for many weeks; that, on his recovery, he\nwrote to Loo and his father, but received no reply from either of them;\nthat he afterwards spent some months in Switzerland, making more than\nenough of money with his brush to \"keep the pot boiling,\" and that,\nfinally, he returned home to find that dear Loo was dead, and that the\ngreat Tooley Street fire had swept away his father's premises and ruined\nhim.  As this blow had, however, been the means of softening his father,\nand effecting a reconciliation between them, he was rather glad than\notherwise, he said, that the fire had taken place.  Fred did not say--\nalthough he might have said it with truth--that stiff and stately Mr\nAuberly had been reduced almost to beggary, and that he was now\ndependent for a livelihood on the very palette and brushes which once he\nhad so ruthlessly condemned to the flames!\n\nAfter this trip to Wales, Frank returned home and told his mother\nabruptly that he meant to marry Emma Ward without delay, to which Mrs\nWillders replied that she thought he was quite right.  As Emma appeared\nto be of the same mind the marriage took place in due course.  That is\nto say, Miss Tippet and Emma managed to put it off as long as possible\nand to create as much delay as they could.  When they had not the shadow\nof an excuse for further delay--not so much as a forgotten band or an\nomitted hook of the voluminous trousseau--the great event was allowed to\ngo on--or, \"to come off.\"\n\nMany and varied were the faces that appeared at the church on that\nauspicious occasion.  Mr Auberly was there to give away the bride, and\nwonderfully cheerful he looked, too, considering that he gave her to the\nman whom he once thought so very unworthy of her.  Willie was groomsman,\nof course, and among the bridesmaids there was a little graceful,\ndark-eyed and dark-haired creature, whom he regarded as an angel or a\nfairy, or something of that sort, and whom everybody else, except Frank\nand Mrs Willders, thought the most beautiful girl in the church.  In\nthe front gallery, just above this dark-eyed girl, sat an elderly man\nwho gazed at her with an expression of intense affection.  His\ncountenance was careworn and, had a somewhat dissipated look upon it.\nYet there was a healthy glow on it, too, as if the dissipation were a\nthing of the distant past.  The dark-eyed girl once or twice stole a\nglance at the elderly man and smiled on him with a look of affection\nquite as fervent as his own.  There was a rather stylish youth at this\nman's elbow whose muscles were so highly developed that they appeared\nabout to burst his superfine black coat.  He was observed to nod\nfamiliarly to the dark-eyed girl more than once, and appeared to be in a\nstate of considerable excitement--ready, as it were, to throw a\nsomersault over the gallery on the slightest provocation.\n\nOf course, Miss Tippet was there in \"_such_ a love of a bonnet,\" looking\nthe picture of happiness.  So was Mr Tippet, beaming all over with joy.\nSo was Miss Deemas, scowling hatred and defiance at the men.  So was\nDavid Boone, whose circumstances had evidently improved, if one might\njudge from the self-satisfied expression of his face and the splendour\nof his attire.  John Barret was also there, and, close beside him stood\nNed Hooper, who appeared to shrink modestly from observation, owing,\nperhaps, to his coat being a little threadbare.  But Ned had no occasion\nto be ashamed of himself, for his face and appearance showed clearly\nthat he had indeed been enabled to resist temptation, and that he had\nrisen to a higher position in the social scale than a vendor of\nginger-beer.\n\nIn the background might have been seen Hopkins--tall and dignified as\never, with Matty Merryon at his side.  It was rumoured \"below-stairs\"\nthat these two were engaged, but as the engagement has not yet advanced\nto anything more satisfactory, _we_ hold that to be a private matter\nwith which we have no right to meddle.\n\nClose to these stood a group of stalwart men in blue coats and leathern\nbelts, and with sailor-like caps in their hands.  These men appeared to\ntake a lively interest in what was going forward, and evidently found it\ndifficult to restrain a cheer when Frank took Emma's hand.  Once or\ntwice during the service one or two other men of similar appearance\nlooked into the church as if in haste, nodded to their comrades, and\nwent out again, while one of them appeared in the organ loft with a\nhelmet hanging on his arm and his visage begrimed with charcoal, as if\nhe were returning from a recent fire.  This man, feeling, no doubt, that\nhe was not very presentable, evidently wished to see without being seen.\nHe was very tall and stout, and was overheard to observe, in very Irish\ntones, that \"it was a purty sight intirely.\"\n\nWhen the carriage afterwards started from the door, this man--who bore a\nstrong resemblance to Joe Corney--sprang forward and called for three\ncheers, which call was responded to heartily by all, but especially by\nthe blue-coated and belted fellows with sailor-like caps, who cheered\ntheir old comrade and his blooming bride with those deep and thrilling\ntones which can be produced in perfection only by the lungs and throats\nof true-blue British tars!\n\nNow, it must not be supposed that this was the end of Frank's career.\nIn truth, it was only the beginning of it, for Frank Willders was one of\nthose men who know how to make a good use of money.\n\nHis first proceeding after the honeymoon was to take a small farm in the\nsuburbs of London.  He had a tendency for farming, and he resolved at\nleast to play at it if he could make nothing by it.  There was a small\ncottage on the farm, not far from the dwelling-house.  This was rented\nby Willie, and into it he afterwards introduced Ziza Cattley as Mrs\nWilliam Willders.  The widow inhabited another small cottage not a\nhundred yards distant from it, but she saw little of her own home except\nat night, being constrained to spend most of her days with one or other\nof her \"boys.\"\n\nAs the farm was near a railway station, Willie went to town every\nmorning to business--Saturdays and Sundays excepted--and returned every\nevening.  His business prospered and so did Mr Tippet's.  That\neccentric old gentleman had, like Mr Auberly, been ruined by the great\nfire, but he did not care--so he said--because the _other_ business kept\nhim going!  He was not aware that Willie's engineering powers turned in\nall the money of that other business, and Willie took care never to\nenlighten him, but helped him as of old in planning, inventing, and\ndiscovering, to the end of his days.\n\nThere was one grand feature which Frank introduced into his suburban\nestablishment which we must not omit to mention.  This was a new patent\nsteam fire-engine.  He got it not only for the protection of his own\nfarm, but, being a philanthropic man, for the benefit of the surrounding\ndistrict, and he trained the men of his farm and made them expert\nfiremen.  Willie was placed in command of this engine, so that the great\nwish of his early years was realised!  There was not a fire within ten\nmiles round them at which Willie's engine was not present; and the\nbrothers continued for many years to fight the flames together in that\nneighbourhood.\n\nAs for stout George Dale, and sturdy Baxmore, and facetious Joe Corney,\nwith his comrades Moxey, Williams, and Mason, and Sam Forest, those\nheroes continued to go on the even tenor of their way, fighting more\nbattles with the flames in six months than were fought with our human\nenemies by all our redcoats and blue-jackets in as many years, and\nwithout making any fuss about it, too, although danger was the element\nin which they lived, and wounds or death might have met them any day of\nthe year.\n\nFor all we know to the contrary, they may be carrying on the war while\nwe pen this chronicle, and, unless more vigorous measures are adopted\nfor _preventing_ fire than have been taken in time past, there can be no\nquestion that these stout-hearted men will in time to come have more\noccasion than ever for--fighting the flames.\n\nTHE END.\n`","<template>\n    <div>\n        <h2>Welcome to the Left/Right shift typing test</h2>\n        <Info\n            v-if=\"state === 0\"\n
