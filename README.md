# Left/Right shift test

This is a simple typing test that does a few very simple things:

1. Tracks how many times you use the left shift key vs. the right shift key.
1. Tracks how many times you use the backspace key.
1. How correctly you type. (shown as a word diff)

This application was written for curiosity reasons and to make a silly toy app with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

Currently it only has one canned passage to test on taken from Fighting the Flames by R.M. Ballantyne courtesy of [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).

If you want to take the test go [here](https://kschow.github.io/left-right-shift-test/).
